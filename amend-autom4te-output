# Introduction and rationale.
# ################################################################

# I want my portable shell scripts to start with an appropriate shebang line,
# referring the shell that JITTER_SHEBANG expands to; the value for the
# substitution JITTER_SHEBANG is computed by configure and then replaced by
# config.status .
# The problem with this design is that I cannot just write a shebang line
# using @JITTER_SHEBANG@ at the beginning of my source scripts ending in
# .in.m4sh : such a line would not reproduced in the output because of how
# AS_INIT works: everything in the source before the AS_INIT call (in
# m4-utility/jitter-script.m4sh , included in my script sources via m4_include
# ) expands to nothing in the output .in files.
#
# In order to work around this issue here I am prepending a comment to what
# autom4te produces, the first line being of course the approprieate shebang
# as per @JITTER_SHEBANG@ ; config.status will later substitute @JITTER_SHEBANG@
# with the correct value.
# Down below in the expansion there will still be the default shebang produced
# by autom4te , but that will be ignored as an ordinary comment.


# Command line.

# Fail fatally because of a command-line syntax error.

Usage: $0 FILE|OPTION
Amend a shell script template (ending in .in , and generated from an .in.m4sh
source) by prepending a shebang line using @JITTER_SHEBANG@ .

Options:
  --help                       print this help
  --version                    show the version number

Report bugs to <@JITTER_PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@>.

EOF
    exit 0
  elif test "$1" = '--version'; then
    cat <<EOF
$0 script from @JITTER_PACKAGE_NAME@ @JITTER_PACKAGE_VERSION@
