;;;; Notes for myself.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; FIXME: What about two column-0 "end" lines, one directly after the other?
;;; That would be worth supporting.

;;; Support comment commands.  Test with M-j  ,  C-x ;  .

;;; comment-start-skip , comment-start , comment-end , comment-multi-line ,
;;; comment-indent-function seem the right solution.  But I'm too tired now.

;;; completion-at-point-functions : this looks easy.

;;; See (elisp) §22.2.1 Major Mode Conventions.

;;; jitter-mode-hook is automatically defined .  Does it actually run hooks by
;;; calling run-mode-hooks ?  I should add a hook and see if it works.

;;; Ideally, I should make sure this does the right thing: `syntax-ppss'.  It
;;; computed "the syntactic state corresponding to a given buffer position",
;;; which is useful for indentation.  Jitter's syntax should be friendly to it.
;;; The return value of `syntax-ppss' is supposed to be "the same as if you call
;;; the low-level parsing function ‘parse-partial-sexp’ from the beginning of
;;; the buffer to POS, but using and updating a cache for efficiency.  See
;;; (elisp)§34.6.2 and the following sections.

;;; Indentation: see the variables `electric-indent-chars'
;;; `electric-indent-inhibit' (let it remain nil) and the functions
;;; `indent-line-function'.  SMIE, based on operator precedence parsing,
;;; (elisp)§22.7.1"Simple Minded Indentation Engine" might work for me: it
;;; automatically provides ‘forward-sexp’ ‘backward-sexp’ and `transpose-sexps'
;;; and works well with syntactically-incorrect code.

;;; Without SMIE (since Jitter has a simple syntax), I shoud look at
;;; (elisp)§31.17.2"Indentation Controlled by Major Mode".  There is
;;; even support for indenting embedded code in a different language!
