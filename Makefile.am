# A remark about libraries
# ################################################################

# The Jitter runtime consists of one library per dispatch, of which the
# default-dispatch library is also provided with a different name.  Such
# libraries are built internally by joining together several Libtool convenience
# libraries (please search for "convenience library" in the GNU Libtool and the
# GNU Automake manuals: the phrase has a precise meaning), and are themselves
# built as convenience libraries.

# This allows to link the Jitter runtime both statically and dynamially and,
# which is important, to build a larger *library* instead of a program
# containing the Jitter runtime.  I expect such larger libraries to be
# a common use case, when the user abstract functionality built on top of a
# Jittery VM into a different software object intended for the user, with a
# simple API.

# Since the libraries built here are all convenience libraries I cannot use the
# name "convenience" to distinguish some intermediate part from one of the final
# runtimes.  I will call "partial" the libraries which are not useful without
# other parts added.

# Rationale:
# In an ordinary application it would make sense to distribute generated files

# system of Jitter itself, which allows to rebuild those files.  And they are
# only examples, so they are not crucial to build, nor indeed built by default.
# If the user is able to run the examples or the testsuite, then there is some
# emulator allowing her to regenerate the files as well.
EXTRA_DIST += $(JITTER_NON_GENERATED_FILES)

# ...But in this case we can't use BUILT_SOURCES.  We will use regular

# A final remark on JITTER_GENERATED_FILES : it would make sense that such
# generated files depended on the bin/jitter$(EXEEXT), but adding such
# dependencies would break distcheck , forcing writes to the source directory
# after bin/jitter$(EXEEXT) is rebuilt.
#
# In practice I find distcheck more important that my own convenience when

# distcheck may be useful for people other than the maintainer.

# A remark about building examples and their library dependencies.
# ################################################################

# All the example executables depend on the main Jitter library (in the variant
# for every relevant dispatching model) but these dependencies are not enforced.
# Automake doesn't automatically track these dependencies, because we link
# libraries in *_LDADD , thru $(JITTER_*LDADD) , with -lLIBRARY rather than
# libLIBRARY.la .  The practice here is more useful as an example for Jitter
# users.
#
# The dependencies could be enforced by defining EXTRA_target_DEPENDENCIES for
# each example target, if I wanted the thing to be completely proper.  But
# Jitter users never need to think about this, and it's better not frighten them
# with the added complexity.
#
# In practice building the target "all" before building any specific example
# program is enough.
