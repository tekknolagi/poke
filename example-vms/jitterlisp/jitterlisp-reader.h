   The user can destroy the pointed string after reading is over; in that case,
   however, it's her responsibility to keep a pointer to the original beginning
   of the string: at every character read the pointer-to-pointer-to-char which
   is passed as the char-reader state will be dereferenced, and the pointed
   pointer-to-char advanced. */

   function reading *one* s-expression, but possibly spanning multiple lines,
