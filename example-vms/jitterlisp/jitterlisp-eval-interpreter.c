/* This data structure holds a binding from variable to value representing a
   non-global environment.  Non-global means local (procedure arguments, let)
   plus non-local (locals from outer static contexts) variables.  Global
   variables are handled differently, with a value directly stored in the symbol
   data structure.  Non-global bindings have precedence over global bindings.
   The most recent non-global binding has precedence over the previous ones, and
   will be the first to be removed.  As non-global bindings follow a LIFO
   discipline the underlying data structure is, unsurprisingly, a stack.

   Variables are encoding as symbols and compared by identity.  This
   functionality is for this compilation unit's internal use, not exported in a
   header: the VM implementation will need something similar but not identical,
   and I still have to figure out the details. */

   careful checking, to ensure that symbols from an evaluation environemnts
