# to be easier to manage, with the user distributed tree looking the same as
# my development tree; in this case every built C file is also distributed.

################################################################

# the actual human-written sources.
#
# It is not inconceavable that, in some cross- configurations, we have a jitterc
# working on the host platform but not on the build platform.  In that case we
# can still do something useful as long as we distribute the C files generated
# by Jitter.  Since we also distribute the C files generated by Flex and Bison,
# as per the GNU coding standards, this means that in this case every file in
# $(BUILT_SOURCES) is also distributed.

# This entire section serves to make this build system live inside the main one,
# in a slightly anonymous way.  A user learning how to build Jitter into her own
# program from this Makefile.am can ignore all of this.

# This is a special package, distributed within another package as an example.
# In this case I don't want to be bothered by generated files, so I let
# maintainer-clean be particularly aggressive, more than the GNU coding
# standards recommend.
