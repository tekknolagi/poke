/* Introduction.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* This is a default style for the Structured VM, reasonable for terminals with
   a black background.  It looks much better with at least 256 colors, which is
   supported in practice by most modern terminals even when they do not set the
   TERM variable accordingly: the user is invited to try
     TERM=xterm-256color
   . */
