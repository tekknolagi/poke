/* Procedure prolog, the version relying on callq / retq .

   It is okay for %[the_link_lvalue] to be an offsettable memory operand
   relative to %rsp: in this case, as per the intel documentation about the
   "pop" instruction, its effective address is computed relative to the value of
   %rsp *after* a quad has been popped, which is what we want here: the
   temporary effect of altering %rsp by pushing and popping the return address
   is not visible elsewhere.  Anyway, it is *not* okay for %[the_link_lvalue] to
   be anything more complex, whose effective address needs to be computed using
   one or more separate instructions: in that case %rsp would have the wrong
   value.  This is why we introduce jitter_the_link_value (register or
   %rsp-relative) as a temporary.  The idea is computing the effective address
   for link_lvalue *after* the popq instruction.  But if link_lvalue is in a
   register we lose no efficiency: the memory clobber won't affect it, so
   jitter_the_link_value will be kept in the same register, and this entire
   macro will expand to a single "popq %REGISTER" instruction.  As far as I can
   see we should lose no efficiency even if link_lvalue were at an offset from
   %rsp , but in this case I never see the generated cose as popq OFFSET(%rsp),
   which is a pity.  I may have been too conservative here in some place I'm not
   seeing, or maybe this inefficiency is necessary. */

/* On x86_64 any 32-bit write to a 64-bit register (but of course not a 32-bit
   store) automatically sets the high 32 bits to zero -- this is a zero-extend,
   not a sign-extend.
   Moreover there is no direct way of loading a literal to a register without
   supplying an immediate smaller than 32 bits.  The choice, therefore, is
   limited to just 32-bit (non-negative and up to 1 << 31 included) or 64-bit
   (otherwise). */
/* FIXME: no, there's another useful case: I can load a 32-bit negative literal
   into a 64-bit register with a movq, and in this case it's sign-extended --
   with the instruction being much shorter than a movabsq:
     48 c7 c3 ff ff ff ff   # movq $-1, %rbx # the 64-bit register value is negative
   Which is different from, say,
     bb ff ff ff ff         # movl $-1, %ebx
   , where the result as a 64-bit integer is positive -- I already cover this.
   What shall I do about this with memory residuals?
   I could even use
     31 db         # xorl %ebx, %ebx
     83 c3 01      # addl $0x1, %ebx
   to load constants in [1, 127] into 64-bit registers.
   This:
     31 db         # xorl %ebx, %ebx
     48 83 c3 ff   # addq $-1, %rbx   # sign-extended
   works for constants in [-128, -1].
   Are these fast?  Is there a way not to have them affect flags?  I doubt it.
   This is good for loading 1, assuming it's fast (not so sure: incq modifies
   some flag, and /mnt/big/handbooks/assembly/intel/optimizing-subsnippets-in-assembly-language--fog--1996-2016.pdf §16.2 recommends using add/sub when optimizing for speed, vs. inc/dec when optimizing for size unless we expect no penalty from flag dependencies, which might or might not be my case):
     31 db         # xorl %ebx, %ebx
     48 ff c3      # incq %rbx

   FIXME: See /mnt/big/handbooks/assembly/intel/optimizing-subsnippets-in-assembly-language--fog--1996-2016.pdf , §10.2 "Using shorter constants and addresses".
