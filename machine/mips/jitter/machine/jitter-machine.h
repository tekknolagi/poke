/* MIPS has a slti/sltiu (set register to 1 or 0 according to a less-than
   comparison, possibly unsigned, of another register against an immediate)
   instruction but no equivalent operation for greater, not-less or not-greater.
   So, implement every conditional as a less-than test followed by a conditional
   branch on either zero or non-zero: two instructions total, without counting
   the delay slot.

   What follows is embarrassingly simple but seems to use slti/sltiu the right
   way without ever generating unneeded xori instructions to negate a
   comparison: the trick is letting GCC do it, using inline assembly for the
   conditional branch on zero/nonzero but not the comparison itself.  As long as
   I do not have patch-in support for literals (which I might eventually want to
   have -- use case: comparison against a constant in the guard of a VM for
   loop, counting up) this might in fact be optimal, thanks to the logic of low-
   versus high-level conditional fast branches, which now takes care of
   rewriting conditionals into simpler forms.
   Someday I will have to carefully look at the disassembly and see if there is
   any case which I would compile differently, but I have not found any yet. */
