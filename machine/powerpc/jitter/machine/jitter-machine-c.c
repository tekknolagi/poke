     play it safe here, unless there is some good way of finding what the CPU
     is, possibly at initialization.  The clcs instruction returns the cache
     line size, but it only works on POWER -- not on PowerPC.

     This method seems to work reliably on my machine, but it might be overkill.

     For each block of written instructions:
     - flush the block from dcache to "memory" (I hope this actually means
       from L1D to L2);
     - invalidate the same block in L1I.
     After we have done this for every block, do a sync to wait until everything
     which was supposed to go to "memory" is actually there.
     Finally, do an isync to drop any previosuly prefetched instruction having
     already found its way into the pipeline. */
