     %r23 %r24 %r25 %r26 %r27 %r28 %r29 .
   This is already excellent, but I suspect a few others might work as well.  For
   example GCC says that %r31 is used as a frame pointer, but stops complaining if
   I use -fomit-frame-pointer -- which I certainly do for VMs.
   I have seen this error message attempting to use %r30 on 32-bit PowerPC
   GNU/Linux:
     error: 30 cannot be used in asm here
   Not using it seems to solve the problem, so I deduce that %r30 is not usable,

   has instructions not accepting specific registers as arguments. */
