/* Rewrite rule introduction.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* A rule is a <guard, pattern, template> triple.  It means that when the
   trailing part of unspecialized VM program which is being built matches the
   pattern, it is replaced by the template instantiated by replacing template
   placeholders with their matched arguments, if the guard is true.  The
   replacement is allowed to trigger other rules, and it's the user's
   responsibility to ensure that the process eventually terminates.

   A rewrite rule pattern consists of a sequence of one or more instruction
   patterns.  The pattern matches one or more unspecialized strictly sequential
   (with no labels or caller instructions in between) instructions.  A pattern
   is not required to be linear, which means that the same placeholder may occur
   more than once: for a pattern to match, equal arguments must match equal
   placeholders.

   A rewrite rule template is a list of instructions with template expressions
   in place of their arguments.  Template expressions may use constants and the
   placeholders matched in the pattern part.

   A guard is a template expression whose result is a boolean.  If, after
   matching, the guard evaluates to false then the rule does not fire.

   We say that a rule matches when a substitution can be found for every
   instruction in the pattern, which means that the opcodes must match
   and every argument must match the corresponding argument pattern, and
   the guard is true. */

   information than just an AST, which is useful for validating rules against
   the specified instructions.  Since rules and instructions can occur in any
