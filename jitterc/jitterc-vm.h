/* The data structures defined here are used at code generation time, not at VM
   run time.

   some code factoring with the code in the jitter/ directory would be desirable
   in a few cases where duplication is just a consequence of the order the code
   was written in, as the project got more and more ambitious--my original
   experiment had a very crude code generator implemented as a shell script--but
   most of the data structures actually *need* to be distinct: most of the VM
   representation as defined here would remain unused at run time, and most
   run-time structures rely on VM-specific generated code for efficiency. */

/* All the data structures here are malloc-allocated.  We do not bother freeing
   them, since they will all only live as long as the generator, and memory use
