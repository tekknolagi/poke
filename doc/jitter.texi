@node Introduction
@unnumbered Introduction

@c The introduction is written in the first person singular, and uses
@c a more informal tone than the rest.  The clear fracture in style
@c from the introduction to the first chapter is intentional, meant to
@c convey first a more personal, vaguely sentimental touch, and then
@c the reliable terseness of comprehensive documentation.  This
@c distinction should be kept.

@cindex specification
@cindex portability
@cindex high-level

@cindex overhead, dispatching (zero)
@cindex dispatching overhead (zero)
@cindex zero, dispatching overhead
Jitter is a software automatically building a portable, very
efficient language virtual machine with performance close to
native code, starting from a relatively high-level
@dfn{specification} provided by the user.
@cindex register, VM
@cindex stack, VM
@cindex runtime data structure, state
@cindex state, runtime data structure
@cindex data structure (state)
The VM state may use registers, stacks, a combination of both or any
runtime structure defined by user code; whenever possible the generator
attempts to map such state data structures into hardware machine
registers.
@cindex C
@cindex API
The specification contains some C code associated to every VM
instruction; the generator takes care of combining such small code
snippets into a whole body of code with low---often zero---dispatching and
branching overhead.
The generated code includes a simple C API to dynamically emit and
execute VM code, and a self-contained driver program for running VM
routines from text files.

@cindex dispatch
@cindex assembly code
@cindex VM independence
@cindex architecture-specific assembly
@cindex conditional compilation
The generated C code is heavily conditionalized and can be configured
to run using different dispatching techniques, of varying
sophistication; the most efficient dispatching techniques rely on some
architecture-specific---but @emph{not} VM-specific---assembly support
already included in this software; every dispatching model but one
also relies on GNU C extensions.
@cindex @code{switch} dispatching
@cindex ANSI C
@cindex C, ANSI
As a fallback case, in the interest of portability, one dispatching
technique is provided, @dfn{@code{switch} dispatching}, requiring nothing
more than standard C.
@*
Configuration parameters are transparent with respect to the VM
semantics and even the C API: a VM routine will always behave in the
same way independently from the dispatching technique and other
configuration parameters, the only observable difference being
execution speed.

@cindex JIT
As long as they are willing to respect the license most free software
maintainers whose projects include an interpreter of some kind should
seriously consider replacing their execution engine with a VM
generated by this software.
@c FIXME: first person singular.  Say ``jittery'' here?
@cindex Jittery
A @dfn{Jittery VM} will easily surpass any interpreter in performance
and should even be competitive against JITs, with the sources being
much easier to maintain and portability coming for free.

@cindex epsilon
@cindex GNU epsilon
@cindex @epsilonzero{}
GNU epsilon (see @ref{Top,,, epsilon, The GNU epsilon Manual}) is a
programming language and my own main project, still to be officially
released as ``stable'', built on an extremely simple core language
called @epsilonzero{} and augmented with powerful syntactic
abstraction.  I have been working on epsilon for many years, rewriting
it from scratch at least five times in a strenuous effort to make it
``right''.  Even if many details of the implementation can still use
more than some fine tuning, I believe that at least its general
architecture is now correct.

@cindex @epsilonzero{}
@cindex standard C
@cindex ANSI C
@cindex C, standard
@cindex C, GNU
@cindex GNU C
epsilon is a general-purpose language, combining very low-level
control (ideally at a level finer than GNU C; certainly finer than
standard C) with high-level features allowing the user to express and
combine complex syntactic forms.  Ultimately every piece of epsilon
code, no matter how complicated, gets rewritten into @epsilonzero{}
before execution or compilation.  Interpreting @epsilonzero{}
is easy, but very inefficient.

@cindex @epsilonzero{}
@cindex self-modification
Even worse epsilon is written in itself: execution begins from a crude
``bootstrap'' @epsilonzero{} interpreter running through the
definitions of every high-level form, as macros and expression
rewrites, which eventually make the language usable by humans.  This
idea of incremental definition relies on an epsilon program modifying
itself in the style currently popular in the ``dynamic language''
community: global procedure, macro and variable definitions are added or
replaced @emph{at run time}, in a way challenging the traditional idea
of compilation.  On the other hand, and differently from what happens with
the fashionable ``scripting languages'', epsilon programs usually
reach a point in their execution after which they stop self-modifying
and become suitable for traditional, efficient compilation to machine
language.  This final compilation of non-self-modifying programs after
they are automatically rewritten into @epsilonzero{} is,
unsurprisingly, easier than in other languages; but executing a
program while still in its ``dynamic'' form has always been
frustratingly slow.

Bootstrapping takes minutes even on a fast machine
and interactive use, if not properly painful, lacks the expected
smooth @emph{feel}, the occasional ``embarrassing pause'' at the end
of a complex macro invokation reminding the user every time that the
implementation has not been tuned quite in the right way.
@ignore
FIXME: this specific ergonomy problem may lie in the uneven time
distribution rather than in the amount of delays: uniformly slow
interactive language implementations, such as CPython, @emph{feel}
better.
@end ignore

@cindex direct threading
@cindex AST
@cindex abstract syntax tree
@cindex git
@cindex stack
Attempting to accelerate @epsilonzero{} interpretation I quickly
put together a stack-based direct-threaded interpreter, with the
intention of using it in place of the current abstract-syntax-tree
interpreter.  That implementation still lives on a git branch but I
will not integrate it in the mainline: at only 4-6x its speedup was
disappointing.

@cindex dependency, from epsilon (none)
@cindex patch-in
@cindex specialization
In order to experiment with fast interpreters I started a new
threaded-code prototype independent from epsilon.  Very soon I had the
idea of @dfn{specialization} (@pxref{specialization}), one of the
few true innovations in this project along with patch-ins
(@pxref{patch-ins}), despite its
simplicity; the results were promising, but again the simple
combination of direct threading and specialization was not enough to
achieve the speedup I was expecting.  I found myself reading and
re-reading scientific papers (@pxref{Bibliography}), and adding more
sophisticated ideas to my prototype to the point where it is now
debatable whether the software still counts as an @emph{interpreter}
generator.
@*
Some ideas definitely belong more in JITs than in threaded
interpreters, and in fact the most advanced dispatching model
supported by Jitter requires no threaded code to be processed at run time,
nor indeed any data structure representing a routine other than an array
of native machine instructions in executable memory---``interpreting''
a routine means jumping to its first native instruction, from where
execution continues.
@c FIXME: justify the name here?

Soon enough what I had planned as just a fun hack for a few
weekends turned into something ambitious and useful for others,
independent from epsilon which will now require it, but @emph{without
being required itself} for compiling or running Jitter.

@cindex inertia, cultural
Language virtual machines are fashionable: people like to compile to
VMs for portability, and to reuse the same VM as a target for several
different languages, forcing VM specifications on one hand to maintain
backward compatibility, and on the other to provide some level of
generality.

The VM-runtime design nowadays has gotten so pervasive to be almost
the expected default, to the point that the word ``unmanaged'' was
coined to describe a language runtime @emph{not} depending on a
virtual machine, as if directly generating physical machine
instructions were some kind of oddity requiring justification.

I disapprove of this trend.

@subsection When @emph{not} to use VMs

@cindex portability
@cindex porting
@cindex VMs for portability
First of all the idea of compiling to a VM for portability relies on
the presence of some runtime system, usually very large and either
written in a low-level language, therefore simply shifting the
portability problem, or mostly built on the VM language itself making
programs less efficient than it would be otherwise possible,
particularly at startup.
@*
@cindex portability
@cindex porting
@cindex VMs for portability
@cindex JIT
Moreover most languages need some form of compilation to machine code
to attain an acceptable level of performance.
JITs are now a part
of all language VMs aiming at serious performance, but again they are
not trivial to port, and nowadays most JITs will target just the one or
two most popular hardware architectures.
@*
@cindex portability
@cindex rationalization
@cindex C
@cindex Autoconf
@cindex Automake
@cindex GNU Autoconf
I have grown skeptical of claims about language VMs as a solution for
portability: if that were really the main concern then simply using C
plus some reasonable tool for handling configurations (GNU Autoconf
comes to mind) would provide for even better portability, and without
compromises on performance.

@cindex JVM
@cindex bytecode verification
@cindex verification, bytecode
@cindex safety
@cindex sandboxing
A few VMs also provide features unrelated to portability, particularly
sandboxing or some safety checking of programs at startup.  Ideas such as
the JVM's ``bytecode verification'', while scientifically interesting,
are a mismatch for most use cases and should never get in the way of
running compiled code efficiently.

@cindex coupling (lack thereof)
@cindex decoupling
@cindex API, public (VMs)
@cindex VM as a stable API
@cindex back-compatibility
@cindex stable, VM specification
@cindex JVM
Exposing a VM as a software API decoupled from a compiler is a source
of inefficiency when independent projects with different needs
target the same VM, or even when a single compiler needs to evolve
but at the same time needs to retain compatibility with older
versions of a VM satisfying a given specification; the impossibility
of implementing efficient method tail calls in the JVM depends on such
a case of excessive decoupling---and in some measure, I dare to say,
on a community of programmers in general too conditioned by cultural
inertia and irrational fashions to appreciate the benefit of a clean
break.
@*
@cindex Java
@cindex JVM
@cindex mismatch, performance profile
@cindex fitness (non-), performance profile
@cindex performance profile mismatch
Speaking of Java, the entire performance profile of the JVM stands out
as a @emph{spectacularly} poor fit for server-side web programming, the most
popular use case for the language: processes are spawned often, live
for a short time, compute very little and only consist in running local,
statically compiled bytecode on one physical machine with a known architecture;
bytecode is hardly ever exchanged over the network or generated at run time.

@cindex Java
@cindex JavaScript
@cindex JIT
If Java is one case of incorrect application of VMs its example is
not the only one, nor the worst.  Soon after web browsers started to
include good JITs for JavaScript---an accomplishment in itself for a
language so difficult to execute efficiently---people started to use
JavaScript as a compilation target for @emph{lower}-level languages,
usually restricting the generated
code to the JavaScript subset that current web browsers can JIT-compile
better.  What would have been an entertaining hack turned
into a grotesque perversion of huge machine-generated code with mediocre
performance, and very troubling political implications:

distributing

over the network prevents its users from easily changing the source,
introduces gratuitous dependencies on the network when none would be
needed, and potentially exposes user data to the server opening the
concrete possibility of Orwellian surveillance nightmares.

@cindex Doom
@cindex JavaScript
@cindex 486
@cindex i486
@cindex 1993
On the technical side some of these projects are very impressive: I
have seen the old Doom game run on a web browser at amazing speed, the
frame rate on my new computer almost approaching what my 486 could
do in 1993.
@cindex C
@cindex JavaScript
@cindex overhead
@cindex multiplication, of overheads
This is not sarcasm: the technical achievement @emph{is} truly
impressive; the route from hand-written C code machine-translated
to JavaScript, then after the network transfer loaded onto my client,
turned into some intermediate representation and from there to native
machine language running in a sandboxed environment, is not trivial by
any mean.
Considering that by stacking abstraction layers one on top of
another their overheads @emph{multiply}, this result is good;
and I am sure that there exist problem instances where this composed
multiple machine-translation works even move efficiently.
Whether such an organization makes sense, of course, is an entirely
different matter.

@cindex C
@cindex Lua
@cindex JavaScript
This is not all.  I have seen @emph{interpreters} for high-level
scripting languages, originally written in C and already quite
inefficient when natively compiled, machine-translated into JavaScript
to be run over a JIT in a client web browser, in order to interpret
script code downloaded from the web.
The performance impact is @emph{not} invisible, and the supposed advantage
questionable at best:
being able to run page scripts in some other (very similar) language rather
than JavaScript, or running programs without having an interpreter
installed---because in 2019 people who install software and just
@emph{compute} on their computers are definitely no longer hip.

As competent programmers with a social conscience it is our duty to

again, and make software architectures more rational and, where possible,
simpler; I believe that this entails, as a first step, moving
applications away from the web and back to local computers directly
controlled by the users.
Redundant abstraction layers must all be stripped away, mercilessly.
@*
@cindex bad practice
Without the illusion of changing irrational minds with rational
arguments we should keep proposing alternative solutions; performance
can be one advantage to present, as long as we use VMs
@emph{sensibly}.  The current popularity of laughably bad practices in
the field might make our job easier and unfold into a competitive
advantage for our side.

End users expect more and more to deal only with the web, relying on
remote services to perform even trivial computations without even the
thought of using their own computer to compute.  The interfaces they
are exposed to are all too weak, and allow hardly any composition and
no abstraction: the idea of a Unix pipe is difficult to visualize for
somebody only accustomed to web interfaces; a shell function feels
hopelessly abstract, like something only useful to experts occupied in
weird tasks well out of the domain of ordinary people.

@node When to use VMs
@subsection When to use VMs

@cindex native machine language
@cindex machine language
@cindex performance
Even very complex programs run best when they are encoded in the
language spoken by the hardware, which is native machine language.
Only in favorable cases and with enormous effort some VMs may approach
the same level of performance.
@*
Providing some form of JIT compilation is nowadays considered more
or less a requirement for a language VM; still, supporting a JIT is
necessary but almost certainly not sufficient to rival native performance.

@cindex alternative to compilers
@cindex alternative to interpreters
@cindex regular expression
@cindex self-modifying code
The correct way of employing language VMs is not as an alternative to
compilers, but @emph{as an alternative to interpreters}.  A few cases
come to mind: programs which are subject to modify themselves often at
run time, and lightweight utilities where code generation is necessary
but complex compiler optimizations are too costly to pay off with
respect to the program expected run time---regular expression matchers
being an example.
A program should employ a VM only for the dynamically generated part of
the code, compiling the rest to machine code ahead of time.  This
yields better performance and allows access to better tools for
developing and debugging the bulk of the program.

@cindex alternative to compilers
@cindex second-tier performance
@cindex ML implementation performance
@cindex Lisp implementation performance
@cindex assembly code
@cindex architecture-specific assembly
Adopting a VM as a compiler target instead of a full-fledged assembly
backend might be a practical stopgap solution in some circumstances, but
it is unrealistic in such cases to expect spectacular results:
compiling to a fast VM will yield, in the best case, second-tier
performance in the range of good ML or Lisp implementations---Usually
simple, sensible systems written in a competent way, but without any
concrete ambition of competing in speed with low-level designs.

@cindex untyped
@cindex dynamically typed
@cindex tuning, of VMs
@cindex variable name
@cindex register
@cindex stack slot
@cindex static chain
@cindex register window
@cindex SPARC
The details of course will depend on the VM language, and the established
practice we are competing against.
A VM for an @emph{untyped} system will probably beat even a more
sophisticated VM for a dynamically-typed language where every primitive
operation requires run-time type checks.
Intelligent VM designs will win against naïve versions: if any
conditional can be moved from run time to VM code generation the
resulting speedup is almost always worth the trouble: translating
variable names into register numbers, stack slot indices or static
chain distances is a good idea, and simpler systems performing
run-time searches on variable names will be easily outperformed.
@ignore
FIXME: Compute some numbers and compare against pypy and luajit
@end ignore
@fixme{People just don't care, not playing the same game: scripting languages.
We can beat even their JITs if we use untyped runtimes.}
@fixme{is the intent of what I'm saying clear?  I want to say that
naïf systems will be beaten by less naïf systems, but the opponents'
naïveté should not be an excuse for making our systems inefficient.
No, I don't think it's clear: I should say this.}


@cindex decoupling
As stated above in my discussion of decoupling it is important
that a VM be specifically designed for the system it supports, to execute its
code in the most efficient possible way; for this reason the VM
language should ideally not be an API to be published as stable and set
in stone, but should rather be subject to change in any future version of the
software, to allow for performance tuning.  Many details will depend on the
language being interpreted, and the performance tradeoff of some
choices may not be obvious; for example parameter passing in a VM can
employ registers, stacks, or SPARC-style register windows; it is
entirely reasonable that a software author may want to switch from one
solution to another in a new release, or even as a configuration-time
decision based on hardware machine features.

@ignore
Even if the feature would be easy to add, right now Jitter does not

@cindex VM reuse

@cindex architecture-specific assembly
The paragraph above holds as an argument against the reuse of
@emph{entire} language virtual machines.  Still some of the code involved
in VMs, at a different level, can and should be reused.
@*
Even if writing a threaded virtual machine is easy, doing it with
attention to efficiency requires some effort.  The idea of
replication, which I have come to regard as essential, entails in
practice automatic code generation techniques which, if conceptually
simple, take time to implement.  The patch-ins infrastructure, if
again intuitive to understand, is laborious to implement
and requires very subtle mechanisms
(@pxref{Defective VM instructions}) to guarantee correctness in
every case.
Several features, technically
optional but very beneficial for performance, rely on a small amount
of hand-written assembly code.  Interestingly such code is specific to the
architecture but completely independent from the VM.  All these
reasons make @emph{the VM construction infrastructure}, rather than VMs,
worth sharing.
@*
Jitter is a solution for such reuse.

For not explicitly supported machines direct-threaded code is always
available as a fallback option, which is as portable as GCC; even
minimal-threading dispatching might work with no explicit porting effort
where @code{mmap} is available and GCC's
@code{__builtin___clear_cache} suffices to invalidate an icache range
along with any necessary dcache flush.

@cindex switch dispatching
@cindex C compiler
@cindex ANSI C compiler
In the unlucky and mostly theoretical case that GCC support were not
available for a CPU the user can always revert to @code{switch}
dispatching, which is supposed to rely only on an ANSI C compiler.
@fixme{Can I run at least minimal-threading dispatch with GCC on a
non-GNU platform?  I think so; I should test on some free software BSD

Jitter is trivial to port to register-based CPU architectures allowing for
a sufficiently wide addressing space: @pxref{Porting}.

@fixme{The kind of architecture-dependent code factoring described
here has little to do with using VMs for portability: the point here
is using VMs for expressivity and having the generated VM run easily
on many platforms, as the machine-dependent code is factored within
Jitter.  If anything, this is about portability @emph{at a meta
level}, in the interest of the VM implementor rather than the user.
Anyway if people want to use a Jittery VM as a portability layer,
against my recommendations, they can.}

@node Expressivity and convenience
@subsection Expressivity and convenience
The ease of use of a VM is a secondary goal compared to its
performance, but working on Jitter convinced me that, luckily, a
convenient C API and intuitive debugging tools are at the very least
@emph{not incompatible} with the need for fast execution on a wide
range of CPUs.

@anchor{compiling-expressions}
Right now a program relying on a Jittery VM has to generate (unspecialized) VM
instructions explicitly, in particular taking care or register allocation
for register-based VMs.  A Jittery VM right now is probably easier to
use than a simple JIT requiring the same explicit register handling by
the user, but less convenient than JITs which accept high-level
expressions.  @fixme{but @pxref{Writing code generators}}

@fixme{Some optional facility for compiling higher-level code
involving expressions (with jumps) can be added to Jitter in the
future; the fact that the VM details are specified by the user makes
an automatic mapping from high-level to low-level code more difficult,
but I think these problems can be solved.}

@fixme{object orientation: absolutely no, never in one million years.
I don't believe in it and I never use it; you can build OO
functionalities with a Jittery VM, but OO should not be a fundamental
mechanism embedded in all data.  Procedures are immensely more
important than methods. @fixme{but @pxref{Late binding}}}

@fixme{closures, function objects.  I don't dislike those, but again
they are not fundamental and can be implemented on top of other
control primitives.  Non-closing procedures are in practice more
important than closures.}

@fixme{type tagging for all data: absolutely not.  That is a recipe
for destroying performance.  It can be implemented, if needed, within
some VM instructions.  Doing that systematically would be a mistake.
In a future
version of Jitter I plan to provide (optional) generation of tagging and
untagging C macros, relying on data specification as provided by the user; the
exact data representation will be chosen by Jitter at generation time.
Of course a user will still be free to do it in her own different way.}

@fixme{exceptions: no, not a fundamental mechanism and way too dependent
on the execution model (but I'm not against them).  They can be implemented.}

@fixme{garbage collection: no, for the same reason.  But a GC must be easy to
interface to the system.  Even one with precise pointer finding.  In a future
version of Jitter I plan to provide an optional precise GC, relying on data
specification as provided by the user.}

@fixme{safety features: static code verification, sandboxing: no,
these kill expressivity, performance, or both.  Static checks can be
added to the VM code generator, and dynamic checks to instructions.
Personally I'd make them optional, but you're free to make things
different.  Running code downloaded from who knows where should be
discouraged.}

@fixme{external representation for code, to be saved and loaded: I
am not a fan of the idea and it is not implemented right now; anyway
it could be added without a lot of pain; the only real problem is just that
some constant expressions involving machine parameters such as the
word size would need to be stored symbolically, in order to be
evaluated at load time.  This can be done quite easily in the existing
VM frontend; the C API would get uglier, but maybe not too much.
The thing can be done in a VM-independent way,
or possibly in a VM-dependent way yielding a very compact binary
format.  Another problem, in the future, will be data embedded in
routines @fixme{did I mean what are now called snippets?}.
Since introducing tagging in every word is out of the
question, data would be in a state where saving is possible only right
after initialization.  Again, this may complicate the C API.}

There is no dependency on the C runtime model: for example switching

instruction, with or without copying, to implement the equivalent of
continuations or just cooperative threads or coroutines.  A Jittery
system can support a garbage collector with exact pointer finding and
a custom memory allocator, if so desired; runtime information about
the type of each object can be made available at runtime if so
desired---or not, when not needed.

@emph{no stack}, with function activation
records allocated on a garbage-collected heap.  Even C
ABIs are only relevant when a Jittery VM calls external functions
written in C.

Jittery VMs' reliance on C at compile time does not prevent them from
deviating from C's runtime model, possibly to a radical extent.
In this sense a Jittery VM is not less general than a JIT directly emitting
native machine instruction under user control.

to a wider range of architectures---essentially, @emph{all} register
machines with a sufficiently wide addressing space.  With the crucial exception
of fast labels my instruction immediates are slightly less efficient than in
Ertl's proposal.  In most instances this disadvantage is canceled, if not

reliant on GCC, and therefore more fragile, than Vmgen---and similar in this

using the TOS optimization, and just one each when not.}

recommending a specific directory organization which will also be
adopted in the following.  It does not cover package systems such as
the one from the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.  As a still young project
as of Summer 2017 Jitter has not yet been packaged by any distribution;

After configuration has succeeded building Jitter should be a simple
matter of running @samp{make}.  This will generate the
@command{jitter} program in the @file{bin} build subdirectory, plus
one runtime library per enabled dispatching model.  Building should be
fast.

At this point it is recommended to build the examples as well, by
typing @samp{make examples}.  Building examples entails executing
the @file{bin/jitter} program generated earlier, which is
not possible under cross-compiling (as @file{bin/jitter} in this case
will match the @emph{host}, rather than the @emph{build}, machine)
unless an emulator was specified; if using an emulator, this is a good
way of testing it for the first time on a relatively simple program.
Building the examples involves compiling large generated C files, which
will be slower than building @file{jitter} and the libraries, and will
also require more RAM.
@*
If everything works the example programs will appear in the @file{bin}
build subdirectory along with @file{jitter}.  Again the example
programs will be one per dispatching model, each with the name
@file{uninspired--} followed by the dispatching model name.  The
``Uninspired'' VM, if not terribly original, is a representative example
of a Jitter virtual machine, to be discussed later in some detail:
@pxref{Tutorial}.

It is still possible to cross-compile the example programs even
without an emulator, by copying the generated C files from another
build---for example a native build on the same machine.  After copying
@file{example-vms/uninspired/*.[ch]} from another @emph{build}
directory (the Uninspired generated files are not sources, and are not
distributed either) to @file{example-vms/uninspired/} under the current
(cross) @emph{build} directory @samp{make examples} should succeed; at
that point the generated files @file{bin/uninspired--*} can be moved
to the host machine and run.
@*
If the generated C files copied from elsewhere are not used by
@samp{make examples} the reason may be a different timestamp: as a
simple workaround you may @command{touch} them: the generated files have
to be more recent than their dependencies for @command{make} not to attempt
to regenerate them.

The test suite will run the ``Uninspired'' VM programs under each enabled
dispatching model, building the Uninspired VM executables as
dependencies if not already present.

@end smallexample
If the number of failures is zero, like in this example, then the test
suite detected no problem; otherwise the output above the summary
needs to be checked more carefully.

@cindex GNU Automake
@cindex TAP test protocol
@cindex test protocol, TAP
@cindex test
The test suite relies on the functionality in GNU Automake and uses
the TAP testing protocol; even used in a simple way as it is TAP
allows for a fine-grained view about the specific nature of the failure,
which helps when investigating a problem.  GNU Autoconf is
also used for shell portability, and to check for optional utilities
to be used at test time when available.  Most of the functionality used
across multiple tests is factored in @file{tests/utility.in}; each
subdirectory of @file{tests} contains one @dfn{test}, as a shell script
(to be preprocessed at configure time in the source tree, and already
preprocessed in the build tree), plus associated data files.
@cindex test case
@cindex case, test
For example the source tree file
@file{tests/interpreter/interpreter.test.in} is a shell script for the
@samp{interpreter} test, to be preprocessed into the build tree file
@file{tests/interpreter/interpreter.test}.  Each test may contain many
individual @dfn{test cases}, each with a 1-based index and a short
human-readable name.  Each test case may pass, fail, or
@dfn{fail expectedly} when a feature is known to be broken.
@cindex Valgrind
@cindex memory leak
Some test cases will be skipped, for example when a dispatching mode
is not enabled, or if the user doesn't have Valgrind available to check
for memory leaks, of again if the test case is only defined on
configurations different from the current one, either lacking or not
requiring a specific feature.

Any @samp{FAIL} line is a symptom of a problem and should never be
ignored.  An @samp{ERROR} line indicates an unexpected problem in the
test script itself, and counts as a bug to report; please do so.

The numbering of test cases will change across Jitter versions, but
some reasonable care will be taken to keep test case names stable; if
you are reporting an unexpected failure, along with the usual
information, please quote the exact line in question, for example
@smallexample
FAIL: tests/interpreter/interpreter.test 44 - count-down minimal-threading
@end smallexample
The test suite subdirectory in the build tree will also contain
data files potentially useful to analyze the problem.  Unless such
files are very large please include them in your reports as well.  In the
case above you may include information about the failed
@samp{interpreter} test case 44 named @samp{count-down minimal-threading}
by sending a tarball containing the relevant files.  You can easily generate
such a file from the build directory:
@smallexample
tar c tests/interpreter/interpreter-44.* | gzip -9 > interpreter-44.tar.gz
@end smallexample

@fixme{be sure to check particularly in critical cases: unusual platform, new GCC version, new Jitter version}

@fixme{in case some test fails reconfigure disabling the offending dispatching model and try again}

@cindex timeout (test suite)
@fixme{A test case hanging is bad.  The Uninspired driver as invoked
from the test suite is supposed to fail after a timeout and the test
scripts contain similar provisions, but the machinery is not
bulletproof, particularly with incorrect machine code running
under emulators or on non-GNU systems.}

x86_64, but that is probably due to bad choices in residual registers.}
Keeping the number of meta-instructions smaller, and making the non-critical
ones non-relocatable, can buy you more fast registers.}

@fixme{number of instruction arguments: residuals have a cost at run time;
non-residuals have a cost at compile time, and may make the VM too large

@fixme{optimize for the common case: for example making division
non-relocatable will probably not be a problem: the time spent in
division will hardly ever be significant, in almost any routine.  This
is probably true for multiplication as well, unless you're doing
graphics.  You can always optimize the common (and cheaper) cases of
multiplying by, dividing and taking the reminder or a power of two
with rewrites into different, relocatable instructions:
@math{a@ 2^b} can be rewritten into @samp{a << b},
@math{a/2^b} into @samp{a >> b} (as long as @math{a} is unsigned)
and @math{a@ mod@ 2^b} into @samp{a & ((1 << b) - 1)}.  The rewrite
targets can have one specialized literal.}

@fixme{CISC vs RISC: cite the APL argument
@fixme{my previous deleted text, to reword:
@emph{The opponents of this argument point out at languages with very
complex primitives such as APL, where the interpretation overhead
becomes proportionally less significant compared to the time spent in
primitives, each one performing a greater amount of useful work than
in other designs.  The counter-argument has the merit of recognizing
one source of the problem, and that languages like APL are indeed
easier to deal with than others.  Still, the part of the community
interested in playing with the fundamental elements of computation,
which certainly includes me, will also demand systems providing
control on a finer granularity, where each fundamental operation is
kept as simple as possible and more complex behavior only emerges as
composition of fundamental operations.  This is the case of epsilon,
Forth, and to a slightly lesser extent, Lisp.}
}}

@fixme{CISC vs RISC, flags: orthogonality is not mandatory.  Having
multiple flags registers like on the PowerPC, or using ordinary
registers to store boolean conditions like on MIPS and Alpha looks
neat, but VM flags registers will not be mapped to hardware flag
registers: the ``pretty'' solution on the VM would force
three-argument comparison instructions, bloating the instruction
space, and on most machines would cost two comparisons instead of one
per jump at run time.  The efficient solution for a VM in this case is
a MIPS-style conditional branch instruction taking two arguments (but
on a VM they can be immediate), and a fast label.  Flags should be
considered inherently transient, and keeping their state in a register
across VM instruction will cost machine instructions.
You should resist the temptation of having both quotient and reminder
computed by one VM instruction, unless the instruction is non-relocatable.}

@fixme{On a VM implied operands (for example a frame pointer or even a
heap allocation pointer held in a fixed register) are fine, as they
reduce the number of VM instruction arguments, limiting their
combinatorial explosion and affording you more fast registers.  It's
perfectly acceptable to design your VM around your ABI: if you change
your mind later, you can change the VM easily: it's not silicon.}

@fixme{constants, particularly if big: specialize if known in advance.}

@fixme{small but performance-performance constants, such as type or
garbage-collection tags: specialize, and define a checking instruction
doing only that, so as to keep the other instructions smaller.  It is
probably better to keep the non-critical path used to handle errors
slow, for example keeping the error handler address on a stack, rather
than passing slow labels around.  Residual arguments are expensive, and
should not be passed every time just to handle rare cases.}

@fixme{fast branches: use the specific macros for conditional branches,
rather than if (condition) BRANCH_FAST(JITTER_ARGF0);
The specific macro generates faster code. @fixme{show the two disassemblies}}

@cindex 68000
Even without having ever tested a complete program I am quite
confident that minimal-threading works already, as long as the GCC
builtin for icache invalidation is sufficient.  PC-relative addressing
can be completely disabled with a GCC command-line option, and I see
no other problems.

Looking at the generated assembly code, and differently from what I
was expecting, I see no big issue with the architecture having
separate register classes for pointers and integers: GCC can still
keep @code{union jitter_word} objects in registers, and will just
generate the occasional register-to-register move instruction when a
VM register allocated to the ``wrong'' class is being used with
operations for the other.

Along with the i386/x86_64 the m68k is among the few surviving
architecture I know having stack-based instructions for handling
procedures, instead of branch-and-link.  Branch-and-link VM operations
can be supported using the same technique I am using on x86_64, with
the mismatch causing the same kind of inefficiency with procedure
calls.  I anticipate that the problem will be more serious on m68k,
its less aggressive implementations providing fewer opportunities to
hide the added latency with instruction-level parallelism.

Testing the m68k architecture is extremely inconvenient for me:
@code{qemu-user} is not usable for m68k, crosstool only supports
@code{nommu} kernels for m68k and does not offer the GNU libc as a
choice; I should install a GNU/Linux distribution on a virtual
machine, then use either a native compiler on the virtual machine or
build a cross-toolchain by hand.  It can be done, but it will be

@node MIPS
@subsection MIPS
@cindex MIPS
No-threading works on 32-bit MIPS with either endianness.
Minimal-threading works on 64-bit MIPS as well, again both big- and
little-endian.

32-bit MIPS is very well supported and has patch-ins for branches,
both unconditional and conditional, and procedures.

I made conditional branches quite efficient despite the slightly
unusual ISA in this respect: MIPS has no conditional flags or separate
compare instruction, and can branch conditionally on either a
two-register equality/inequality comparison or a more general
one-register comparison against zero.  The comparison operation is
part of the conditional branch instruction.  To allow for comparisons
not expressible within the instruction (less, less-or-equal, greater,
greater-than-equal between two registers or one register and and
immediate) MIPS provides a three-operand set-on-less-than instruction,
setting a general register to either zero or nonzero.  The other
possible variants set-on-less-or-equal, set-on-greater and
set-on-greater-or-equal are not provided.

Delay slots are often, even if not always, filled with nops.  I can
write a new pass to be run after replication to fill some delay slots
with the instruction being jumped to, adjusting the target as well.
This would be relatively easy, and cover other cases where the
opportunity is now wasted; the same infrastructure should be reusable
on SH and on SPARC, where ``annulled instructions'' would let me cover
even more cases.

For some reason GCC generates much better code for PowerPC than for
MIPS when register pressure is high, even if the two architectures are
very similar.  I should distill a test case and ask the GCC people.

Pseudo-direct branches are deprecated, but not yet removed, in r6.
Maybe I should just use @code{b} and @code{bal} instead of @code{j}

conditional branches.
It should be possible, and easy, to generate assembly code running on

PowerPC is well supported, and has patch-ins for unconditional

The port includes some inline assembly code to invalidate the icache,
tested on the PowerPC 750 but almost certainly correct for other
PowerPC models as well.

@cindex POWER
POWER is currently untested; looking at the documentation I see some
differences in the required icache invalidation code; however I can
conditionalize that if I ever decide to support POWER, and keep a
single port for both variants.

@cindex j-core
Minimal-threading is currently broken on SH, because of the limitation
on instruction immediate width.  GCC solves the problem by using
PC-relative loads of constants close to the code directly in the @code{text}
section, a perfectly good strategy for ordinary C code but unfortunately
incompatible with my relocated instruction intervals.  Sometimes GCC generates
PC-relative loads even for accessing constant bitmasks or @emph{offsets}
to be used for loading from the stack, when the constants are too wide to
fit in instruction immediates; such cases are unfortunately common in C
functions containing many automatic variables, or function calls.
@*
I need a workaround.

Of course direct threading relies on C only, and works reliably.

As a CPU with free-hardware implementations this architecture should

There is no support yet for conditionals, but that seems easy to add.
VM procedures use the flat model and never change register windows,
which is probably more efficient and certainly leaves a high number of
general registers available.

No-threading works well.

x86_64 is very well supported and has patch-ins for branches, both
unconditional and conditional, and procedures.

Compiling the executor with the GCC option @code{-mcmodel=large} is
an easy and reliable way of preventing the compiler from using
@code{%rip}-relative addressing to access data from relocated code:
the trick is that x86_64 can only encode a displacement from
@code{%rip} as a signed 32-bit field, while the large model allows
for wider displacements.

@fixme{explain how the ``main'' procedure implementation works.}
The implementation also contains an alternative working implementation
of procedures not using @code{call} and @code{ret}.  It relies on
using a @code{%rip}-relative @code{leaq} to load the return address
into a register, and then jumping; this alternative implementation is
actually a branch-and-link, but since on my machine it seems slightly
slower than the other solution it is disabled.  See
@code{JITTER_BRANCH_AND_LINK_NO_CALL}.

The irritating asymmetry of the operands allowed in x86_64 comparison
instructions sometimes makes the order of comparisons (for example
@code{JITTER_BRANCH_FAST_IF_LESS_SIGNED (@var{a}, @var{b}, @var{F})}
versus @code{JITTER_BRANCH_FAST_IF_GREATER_SIGNED (@var{b}, @var{a},
@var{F})}) affect performance.  I can, and plan to, use
@code{__builtin_constant_p} to rewrite the conditional when one of the
operands is a known literal, but GCC gives me no way of distinguishing
a memory operand from a register operand.

Cross-compiling: configure with
@code{--enable-emulator="$(pwd)/libtool --mode=execute qemu-ppc -r 4.6.7 -L /home/luca/usr-cross/powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu/sysroot"}

Configuring with @code{--disable-shared} will speed up builds.

Why not using Gnulib in generated code.

I should find a good name for this software.  ``@file{vmgen}'', possibly
the best choice, has already been taken by the GForth people for a
project quite different from mine, but with a similar aim.

I should explicitly say that the interpreters I care about use a
@dfn{linear program representation}.  Tree- or graph-based
interpreters are too inefficient to consider seriously.
VM instruction may look like native machine instructions, but don't
have to; the focus is performance, and the right solution depends on
what can be implemented most efficiently in a VM.

Motivation: potentially complex instructions, not a good fit for a
traditional JIT; experimenting with calling conventions.

I resisted the temptation of making the thing Lispy, mostly to get
Jitter more easily acceptable to a wider community---even if I really
hesitated when getting to parsing operators with precedence and
associativity, and almost redid everything the sensible way, using
s-expressions.

On reusing VMs.

Big and small machines.  ``Embededd'', whatever it means.

Is it a JIT?

Not even an attempt at being safe.

Mention Forth and vmgen.  Mention QEmu as well.

``Threaded-code'' has nothing to do with multi-threading and concurrency.

The system is agnostic with respect to binary formats: it does not
rely on ELF @fixme{not really} and does noting unusual at link time.  VMs can be made
into dynamic library.  All the dynamic code patching happens at
runtime, after startup, on code with has been already relocated in the
native architecture and endianness --- some architecture-dependent
part of the code patching is of course sensitive to endianness, but
that can be handled with simple preprocessor conditionals (see for
example MIPS instruction patching in
@file{machine/mips/jitter/machine/jitter-machine-c.c}).  All current assembly code
@emph{does} require the GNU assembler (in particular alternative
macros, subsections and the section stack), and I will almost
certainly rely on its features even more in the future.

The code I care about: compilers, symbolic processing.  If I were
doing, say, graphics, my priorities would be different and I'd have
pursued some paths which I've left open.

A program using a Jitter-generated VM does not need to
know the dispatching model or the number of fast registers: it can be
simply linked to one of several libraries generated for a given VM,
all having a compatible APIs.  No preprocessor feature macros are
needed externally and all such libraries are functionally
interchangeable.

Document how to install the Emacs major mode for Jitter, even if it is
completely standard.

Every dispatching model more sophisticated than
@code{switch}-dispatching relies on GNU C, and freely uses GNU C
extensions: @code{typeof}, computed gotos, nested functions, GCC
builtins, function attributes, empty inline assembly with constraints
to notify the compiler of variables changing value out of its control.
More critically, some distpatching models also rely on non-trivial
assumptions about code generated by GCC, which are subject to breaking
with future GCC versions.  A reasonable effort will be made to keep
jittery code from breaking, but the user is encouraged to always rerun
the Jitter test suite after upgrading GCC.

Very little assembly in the source code; almost all inline asm is
actually platform-independent.

Implementation limits:
@itemize
@item
maximum number of residuals per specialized
instruction equal to the number of bits in a word.  Of course this
could be lifted, but it would be painful and almost certainly useless.
This is because of
@code{vmprefix_specialized_instruction_label_bitmasks}
and
@code{vmprefix_specialized_instruction_fast_label_bitmasks}.

@item
Depending on how I encode fast jump instruction placeholders in
compiled code there will be other limit on the number of residuals,
which however will be higher than the previous limit.  Or maybe I can
store the information away from the placeholder, and keep a pointer
@emph{to} the placeholder, keeping informations along with the
pointer.  Yes, this is the best solution.
@end itemize

@code{!BEGINBASICBLOCK} marks the beginning of a basic block
@emph{at the VM level}.  Within each VM instruction, and from a VM
instruction to the very beginning of the next (which at the VM level
is fall-through control), there may be other jumps; these do not
require special provisions, except making sure that each instruction
is compiled into an uninterrupted interval of native instructions,
without ever referring to addresses out of the interval either for
native instructions or data.

@section (Meta-)language
Shall I replace the phrase ``dispatching model'' with something else?
I use it to describe two different runtime behaviors:
@dfn{dispatching}, in the sense of jumping from one VM instruction to
the next, and @dfn{argument access}.  Maybe I should just say
``runtime''.

About the word ``word'': it does not mean what it means in Gas.

Replication/relocation: GForth's ``dynamic superinstructions with
replication'' corresponds to my @emph{minimal-threading} dispatch
model; my @emph{no-threading} dispatching model is close to what
@command{gforth-fast} did.
Jitter does not support ``dynamic superinstructions without
replication''.

GCC is @emph{not} called at run time; that would be very slow, and the
result would probably be inferior (separately compiled code could not
easy share runtime state such as VM registers, without resorting to
globals in memory).  Gas is @emph{not} called at run time either.  In
fact a Jittery VM doesn't need to invoke any external program to work
except @command{objdump} for disassembling, and even that is only useful
for debugging and developing, and therefore not critical for
performance.  VMs do not rely on @file{ld.so} for loading or relocating
generated code: everything is done in memory, on raw instruction
bytes.  There is no @code{dlopen}.

Jittery VMs might be useful as a tool to experiment with garbage
collectors, since it allows for low-level control; Jitter gives the
user much more control over the generated code compared to a compiler,
and I guess replicated code could count as a reasonable approximation
of compiler-generated code when evaluating the performance of a
collector.  With Jitter it is easy to reserve (VM) registers for
special purposes, and to play with weird stack organizations.

Polemical references to what scripting languages do, to be softened:
if your program spends most of the time accessing complicated
associative data structures you should use external functions for
this---or even better @emph{you should not do it}: arrays were
developed for a reason.  Bignums are nice to have, but should not be
used for @emph{all} numbers.  Having floating-point numbers
@emph{only} is stupid for the same reason.  If you have a radical idea
for a computation model and you want to encode everything in it, make
sure that you can recognize the optimizable cases and reduce them to
the fast version almost always.


@section Frontend performance
@code{mmap}; a lot of @code{malloc} and @code{free} which are
difficult to do without, because of rewriting.  But custom heap
allocators might be a good idea for the future, assuming the common
use case is destroying a routine after it's been specialized, and
keeping only the specialized version; this is currently not possible
as both routine versions are kept in the same data structure, but that
will change.

Even in its current state Jitter's frontend should run much faster
than the alternative of spawning @command{gcc} or even just
@command{as} plus @command{ld} processes, and then using @code{dlopen}
to link object code.

Specialization can possibly be made faster (and the generated code
certainly much smaller) by using simple automata techniques of the
same family of those of Flex---the problem involves building an
automaton for specialized instruction prefixes, which I think I can do
directly in DFA form by using a hash at generation time.  I cannot
really tell how much of a problem specialization performance is at run
time without benchmarking a complete Jittery application.  As for
compile time, specialization is heavyweight but not the bottleneck:
the executor, being essentially one huge function, is more demanding on
the compiler than a large set of small static functions calling each
other.  Switching from the current approach based on custom code
generated for each specialized instruction to a single generated table
accessed by hand-written code would shift the load from the
instruction cache to the data cache.  The table-based alternative
would touch less memory, but possibly with worse spatial locality.

The frontend works in passes: instruction specialization is a separate
pass, working on every unspecialized instruction one after the other.
This is probably good.  Will the specializer code and data remain in
L1i and L1d between a specialization pass and the next?  I doubt it.

@section Markup samples for the reference part

@deftypefn {Macro} SWAP @
  (@var{A}, @var{B}) @code{SWAP} assigns the value of @var{A} to
@var{B} and the value of @var{B} to @var{A}.

Both @var{A} and @var{B} must be lvalues.  Each is evaluated exactly
once, in an unspecified order.

The macro expands to a statement, and there is no return value.

@c The example can also be put within the deftypefn block.  The output
@c is indented differently.

@section GCC options
This seems reasonable:
@code{-O2 -fno-gcse -fno-plt -fpic -fpie -fno-crossjumping -fno-reorder-blocks -fno-thread-jumps -fno-jump-tables -fno-tree-switch-conversion}
even if the result is not
satisfactory when fast registers are too many---except on PowerPC,
where the result keeps using registers well; that is surprising as
MIPS should be very similar, but the generated code is much worse.

x86_64: @code{-mcmodel=large} seems to avoid @code{%rip}-relative
addressing altogether in generated code.  This is possibly a
breakthrough, generalizable to other architectures.  Notice that my
hackish way of generating assembly files hides the effect if I
override CFLAGS from the @command{make} command line.

SH: some subset of these options seems to greatly help in generating
better (floating-point) code, even if it's still polluted with @code{fpscr}
modifications and PC-relative loads crashing my replicated code:
@code{-Ofast -funsafe-math-optimizations -ffast-math -fpic -maccumulate-outgoing-args -mprefergot -mnomacsave -mfmovd -ftree-vectorize}
I guess the @code{fpscr} problem would disappear if I built a toolchain
with only one floating-point width.

@section Among design goals
Jitter makes it possible to experiment with compilation techniques:
even runtime features in my opinion too inefficient to use in
production should still be convenient to implement on a VM.  The
development of a runtime system can be made incremental, thanks to the
easily modifiable nature of Jittery VMs.

@section About tracing JITs
They are very fashionable but I'm skeptical about them.  If we are
already translating all the code to an intermediate representation
such as the JVM bytecode or Jitter's unspecialized code we may as well
accept the small additional linear-time overhead of specialization and
compile @emph{everything} to native code.  In a very dynamic
environment where code is rewritten multiple times at run time (like
GNU epsilon does, in some execution phases) old native code can be
garbage collected with finalizers, and its space reused for new
generated code.

I am personally unconvinced about the need for the additional
complexity of tracing.  People who disagree with me can still use
Jitter for generating native code from traces, collected with
mechanisms of their own.

@section VM instruction coarseness, or granularity
It is debatable whether VM instructions should be RISC- or CISC-like.

Native code makes the tradeoffs different from traditional threaded
code, with a RISC design being more feasible, particularly elegant for a
low-level source language and yielding smaller replicated code blocks:
this reduced complexity should make place for increasing the number of
fast VM registers, for better performance.

On the other hand for a very dynamic system a CISC approach might pay
off in dynamic compilation time, reducing the number of VM
instructions to work with in exchange for larger, but fewer, blocks to
copy: this boils down to comparing the performance of @code{memcpy}
against additional VM code generation and specialization, with its
complicated branching and memory access patterns---and @code{memcpy}
is the obvious winner.
Larger VM instructions will also give GCC ampler opportunities to optimize
generating good native instruction schedules, allocating
intra-instruction temporaries in temporary registers, and possibly
unrolling loops.  Composing RISC-like VM instructions cannot yield
native code of the same quality since GCC lacks information about the
interaction between one instruction and the next, and can only work on
each one in isolation.

Whether all of this makes a difference in practice remains to be seen.
If you have numbers to show, I am interested.

@section What a ``basic block'' is
Each ``basic block'' whose entry point is marked by a
@code{!BEGINBASICBLOCK} specialized instructions in some dispatching
models is actually an @dfn{extended basic block} in the sense of a
linear sequence of specialized instructions beginning with its one
@dfn{entry} specialized instruction (any number of predecessors) and
containing one or more @dfn{exit} specialized instructions (any number
of successors, also extended basic blocks) potentially branching out
of the sequence.  An extended basic block may be entered only through
its first specialized instruction, but specialized instructions
exiting the extended basic block may occur at any point within the
block, not necessarily at the end.

A caller specialized instruction, even if conditional. always ends an
extended basic block since returning from the procedure will jump back
to the specialized instruction immediately following it, which
therefore marks the beginning of a different extended basic block.  A
callee specialized instruction is also always at the beginning of an
extended basic block, as it can be a branch target---the difference
between branch and branch-and-link being irrelevant for the purpose of
basic block identification.

The definition above would allow unconditional branches, unconditional
procedure returns or @code{!EXITVM} specialized instructions to always
end a basic block, since the following specialized instruction, if
any, is not reachable through straight-line code and must be a branch
target, if reachable at all.  Jitter does not delimit extended basic
blocks in this way, instead checking (conservatively) which
unspecialized instructions are possible branch @emph{targets}.  This
yields slightly longer extended basic blocks, potentially containing
dead code at the end.  I argue that this is not a problem in practice.
The alternative would be having the user annotate meta-instructions to
identify which ones perform @emph{unconditional} branches; incorrect
annotations would lead to subtle bugs.  Caller meta-instructions
@emph{do} require a user annotation in the form of the @code{caller}
property, for the very purpose of correctly delimiting basic blocks,
without which C macros for branch-and-link are not available to user
code: but in this case the annotation cannot be forgotten if the
meta-instruction code actually contains a branch-and-link operation,
and even a redundant annotation does not yield incorrect code.

I'm not currently using the phrase ``extended basic block'' since I've
seen the same phrase used for slightly different concepts.  This might
change in the future.

@section Emacs mode
Emacs mode: the empty code block here should be recognized as valid, but it isn't.

end
@end example

@section @code{mmap}
@code{mmap} code to low addresses where
possible.  By default Linux doesn't allow user processes to
@code{mmap} the the very first page, but using the space from the
second one (usually @code{0x1000} or @code{0x2000}) to @code{0xffff}
can be a big win for slow labels on RISCs with 16-bit-only
immediates and without fast label support---however the set of those
machines is supposed to become very small.

@section Word size on the target machine
Make sure that @command{jitter} doesn't expand BITS_PER_WORD and
similar macros according to the machine where @emph{it} runs; I'm
almost positive it does now.

This is difficult.  Shall I just generate every possibility?  A
heavyweight solution would be generating every possibility separately
in output C code, with @code{#ifdef}s around to only enable the used
part.  This would make the generated code three times as big (even if
not slower to compile) entailing three sets of definitions:
@itemize
@item 16-bit word
--- it costs nothing more at this point;
@item 32-bit word;
@item 64-bit word.
@end itemize
If I do this it is imperative to do it in a non-invasive way, possibly
by having @command{jitter} call itself more than once, collecting and appending
the generated files; this way the code change can be localized.

@section Non-relocatable instructions
Locally @emph{un}wrap globals and functions.  This is easy and
independent from the rest.

Implement transfer registers, likely in memory, as offsets known at
compile time relative to the @emph{base}.  This is easy.

Second step: generate special specialized instructions (which is to
say, without unspecialized counterparts) to transfer between ordinary
and transfer registers, and to load transfer registers with immediates.

Third step: do not specialize non-relocatable instructions, and insert
transfer instructions around non-relocatable instructions at
specialization time.

@section Machine register use: single @emph{base} [almost done now]
Use a single @emph{base} to point to memory residuals, slow registers and
possibly transfer registers as well.  This is how to organize the
array with multiple data types:
@itemize
@item
first come the residual memory cells, whose number and classes are
known;

@item
then come the transfer registers held in memory, whose number and
classes are again known (shall I overlay transfer registers and memory
residuals?  Any saving would be minimal unless I completely eliminate
one of the two concepts, which will not be feasible with multiple
user-specified data types---it would be feasible now);

@item
then come the slow registers, ordered first by index, then by class:
for example, if there are
three classes @math{A}, @math{B} and @math{C}
and fast registers are
6
(@code{%a0}..@code{%a5},
@code{%b0}..@code{%b5},
@code{%c0}..@code{%c5})
then the slow registers will be, in order,
@code{%a6}, @code{%b6}, @code{%c6},
@code{%a7}, @code{%b7}, @code{%c7},
@code{%a8}, @code{%b8}, @code{%c8}, and so on.
Slow-register residual arguments will be encoded as offsets from the
base: no multiplication needed at run time.
When more slow registers are needed at run time it is easy to grow the
array with @code{realloc}: only the last part changes.
@end itemize
Alignment should be
optimal, possibly by making each field aligned like the
largest-alignment class---this is a simple solution, but it may be
possible to do better.

@subsection Base pointer not at offset zero
The base should not necessarily point to the beginning of this memory
buffer: it can point inside it, at a known offset: this would make
offsets from the base smaller in modulo, giving access to the negative
part as well, which might be important on architectures with only small
immediates (SH, ARM).

@section Alias argument class
Rewriting may make some arguments of the same instruction always equal
to one another; in this case only @emph{one} of them should be
residualized.  This might be important with slow registers, but I
haven't thought much of how to do it.  It's also important to respect
modes: if one alias argument has input mode and another input/output
mode, I @emph{am} allowed to modify the input/output version of it
within the instruction: after all it's the same register.  Hum.  Maybe
it's easier than I think.
@*
It's important that this optimization is automatic: it's not
acceptable to pollute a VM specification with explicit two-argument
versions of meta-instructions, just as rewrite targets.  Jitter should
automatically discover that some arguments are redundant, and
transform the definition.  I guess I will need an ``alias'' argument
class, to be used internally and possibly for the user as well (or
just to make my life easier when debugging).

@subsection Scratch register not reserved
Do not reserve the scratch register: just mark it as clobbered or set
by inline asm in residual-loading code, so that GCC can reuse it as a
temporary.  This would require GCC local register variables, but the
thing is not trivial: residual loading snippets can no longer just be
copied before each instructions, but have to become patch-ins;
otherwise GCC might insert code @emph{around} the local register
variable declaration or inline asm, to save and restore the value
previously held in the scratch register.

This is a lot of work.  An easier compromise might be not to reserve
the scratch register at all, and instead saving and restoring it from
the assembly snippets setting it.

@section Frontend optimization
Optimize the frontend.  In particular, turn checks for impossible
conditions into @code{assert}s, and add a configure option to disable
assertions.  Make fast unsafe versions of instruction-appending
functions, to be used from debugged C code generators -- but not from
the parser, whose input comes from the user.  Measure performance in
generated VM instructions per second or possibly native instructions
per second or bytes per second; on @code{moore} it's currently around
1.7M VM instructions/second, including the parser overhead; I can't
really tell if that's fast, without knowing the numbers for any JITs.

@section Frontend cleanup
Right now the frontend has data structures completely different from
the ones in @command{jitter}.  Much of this distinction is reasonable, but some
encoding, particularly in instruction arguments, could be shared.

@section Memory directives
Let the user specify data along with instructions in symbolic VM
files, and a corresponding C API.

Labels preceding instructions and data will need to be different
because of the difference at specialization time, but it should not be
a limitation to have them be even syntactically distinct.


@c @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@section Stack slot access
Slow registers mapped to a stack, to make procedure calls easier?  Can
I make that general?  I'd say not.

But it would be easy to provide macros accessing the stack slots of a
given non-TOS-optimized stack as l-values.  In order to be efficient
they would be provided in two versions, working with indices and
offsets.

@section Convenience register spilling
Adding macros to spill and unspill all the fast registers, and all
registers up to a given index, would be easy.

This of course would be convenient for the user but suboptimal, so the
feature would consist in macros to be optionally possibly called in VM
instruction code.

@section A ridiculous i386/x86_64 optimization
Add a different pair of call/prolog macros pushing the return address
to a non-TOS-optimized stack.  This would be implemented with inline
assembly on x86 by an @code{xchg} on the @code{%rsp} and a VM stack
pointer, and on the other side as just an xchg; and in normal C for
every other architectures.

This may or may not be worth the trouble, and anyway should not be the
main calling facility.

@section No-threading: generate one C compilation unit per VM instruction
A wild idea: instead of generating the no-threading ``interpreter'' as
a C file containing one huge function with ~10000 labels, I could
generate ~10000 small C compilation units each containing one
function---one per VM instruction.  In order to guarantee
compatibility when composing compiled code I would have to reserve
registers myself for runtime state data structures: this can be done
with GCC global register variables.  I would lose access to data on
the stack shared by all the instructions, but I could use my base
pointer instead of C's stack pointer, without any loss of efficiency.

Instead of generating ~10000 C files I could generate just one, and
use CPP to disable everything but one function at each compilation.
That would make things a little cleaner.

Pros:
@itemize
@item
almost certainly better code: I get to decide exactly what part of the
runtime state goes into registers.

@item
possibly break my dependency on GCC's @code{-fno-reorder-blocks},
which is very critical right now---even if nobody has talked of
removing that option I'm relying on its behavior, which is not
guaranteed anywhere; in fact I'm surprised that GCC can even generate
assembly code exactly respecting the order in the source;

@item
almost certainly, avoiding implicit reliance on code and data defined
in an instruction block and used by another.  This currently breaks
SH, where GCC uses PC-relative addressing to load constants too large
to fit in immediates, which would be a good (and clever) solution
normally, but a problem for my code-copying technique;

@item
Much less memory required for GCC.
@end itemize

Cons:
@itemize
@item
How do I force GCC not to alter the stack pointer before the beginning
or after the end of the code to be copied?  Can I actually reserve
something like @code{%rsp} with @code{-ffixed-REG}?  The documentation
is not completely clear, but I strongly doubt that.  [In fact, I can't].
Were the QEmu people hit by this problem before they switched to their
new code generator?

I'm pessimistic here.  I can keep a global register variable in
@code{%rsp} and reliably read and write it from C even without inline
asm, but I can't prevent GCC from adjusting the stack whenever it
wants, possibly right before my reads or after my writes.

Until I find a solution, this idea is on hold.  Variations of this
alter @code{%rsp} in places impossible to control:
@smallexample
//register void* rsp asm ("%rsp");
register long a asm ("%rbx");
register long b asm ("%r12");
register long c asm ("%r13");
register void* d asm ("%r14");

extern void *beginning, *end;

void
f (void *label)
@{
  asm volatile ("# Function beginning");
  if (__builtin_expect (label == 0, 0))
    @{
      beginning = && beginning_label;
      end = && end_label;
      return;
    @}
  goto * label;
 beginning_label:
  @{
    asm volatile ("# After beginning");
    a ++;

    volatile long p [3000];
    p [0] = 0;
    p [1] = 1;
    p [2] = 2;

    asm volatile ("# Before end");
  @}
 end_label:
  asm volatile ("# After end");
@}
@end smallexample

@item
A lot of time required for the linker.

I suppose that the GCC part of the compilation would still be
heavyweight in time, even it it would become easy to parallelize.  The
stress would move from the compiler to the linker: can GNU LD
efficiently link 10000 compiled modules, each containing one
non-static function?  That is easy to test;

@item
More total time required for GCC?  I am curious about that;

@item
Nested C functions, as I mean to use them (several functions within
the one interpreter function, called by replicated code from the
interpreter function) would break.  But maybe I can work around that;

@item
Possibly very disruptive in Jitter.

@item
What about non-word-sized elements in the status?  Anyway, anything
not fitting in a register would be accessible in memory base-relative.
Everything would remain thread-local, which is good.
