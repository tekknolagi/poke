.SH NAME
Jitter \- an efficient Virtual Machine generator

.SH DESCRIPTION
Alas, there is no information here.

.SH THIS MAN PAGE IS A STUB
The system on which the source tarball was built lacked the
GNU help2man utility or used cross-compilation without an
emulator available to run the produced file with
\fB\-\-help\fR ;
for these reasons this page is just a placeholder.

Anyway, the actual documentation is in Texinfo.
