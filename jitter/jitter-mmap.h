/* Executable memory allocation: introdution.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* This uses the memory heap implemented in jitter-heap.[ch] over executable
   memory allocated by mmap; if portability to system without mmap is required
   in the future, the use of mmap itself will be easy to replace with something
   else.

   There is no support yet for W^X systems.

   The API as it stands now is not reentrant with respect to mulithreading.  If
   excutable memory allocation is desired from multiple threads at the same
   time, the user is supposed to synchronize with a mutex. */
