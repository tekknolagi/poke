/* Introduction.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* In several places Jitter needs heap blocks allocated to a relatively large
   power of two; such blocks are freed when no longer needed.  The best
   implementation uses mmap to allocate a larger block followed by up to two
   munmap calls freeing the unneeded parts of the mapping at the beginning and
   at the end; this technique, while heavyweight, has the advantage of
   immediately returning memory to the operating system as soon as a block is
   destroyed.
   Notice that the block alignment must be a multiple of the system page size;
   on current systems any power of two larger than 32KiB should be supported in
   practice.  Older systems tend to have smaller pages and are even less of a
   problem.  If you know of some exception please report it as a bug, providing
   details.

   On systems lacking mmap but providing posix_memalign the implementation is
   still easy, as the allocated block can be released (to the process, not the
   system) by a call to free.  Despite the general case being slightly more
   wasteful, aligned_alloc can be used as well as another alternative: it
   requires the block size to be a multiple of the alignment, so the
   implementation based on aligned_alloc rounds the demanded size up.

   Finally, on inferior systems lacking all of mmap, posix_memalign and
   aligned_alloc I define an alternative, wasting some space but at least
   allowing to free an allocated buffer.

   This wrapper provides a unified abstraction using the best available
   alternative. */
