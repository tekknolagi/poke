/* Introduction.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* This header defines an extensible output abstraction called "print context",
   allowing the user to print data along with user-specified "decorations" to an
   underlying channel such as a file descriptor, libc stream or socket, or even
   a memory buffer.  A "print context kind" describes the behaviour of
   operations, including the way decorations are handled; every print context
   has a print context kind, plus an underlying channel on which to write.  A
   few print context kinds are provided here; other use cases are possible for
   the user to define using this documented API (pretty-printing comes to mind),
   and might be directly provided here in the future.

   "Decorations" may express semantic attributes such as the nesting level of a
   program form or encode cosmetic features such as fonts, colours or
   hyperlinks, for example as implemented by GNU libtextstyle .  Some (or all)
   decorations will have no effect in some context kinds; a user is still free
   to write any decoration to any print context, and to reuse the same code for
   printing to different contexts -- for example on a terminal supporting
   colours and fonts, to a file, into a buffer in memory.

   The API is meant to be expressive enough for wrapping the functionality of
   GNU libtextstyle for printed colour or font attributes and hyperlinks where
   the library is available, while ignoring such functionality otherwise.
   If the underlying channel abstraction does not support such facilities then
   the additional styling and hyperlinking operations will have no effect, but
   the data output operations will still behave as intended.
   A libtextstyle print context kind is provided in a separate library, as
   explained below, in order not to have libtextstyle as a dependency for
   libjitter.

   It is possible in general to interleave other input/output operations on the
   underlying channel (for example file seeking, or reading) with print context
   operations, as long as the print context is explicitly flushed before each
   explicit access to the underlying channel.

   This API is not by itself thread-safe: in a concurrent environment it is the
   user's responsibility to ensure that critical sections are executed
   atomically.

   The Jitter runtime library prints VM routines and native code disassemblies
   through this facility, generating output to a print context provided by the
   user. */

/* Every function with return type int in this API returns 0 to signify success,
   while any other result signifies failure.
   In case of error these functions may print an unspecified number of
   characters before failing; there is currently no support for error recovery.
   Depending on the definition of the context kind, some of the functions
   defined below may have no effect on the output, and simply return 0.  When
   the context kind in question defines the operation as having any effect, any
   operation is subject to failure.
   Notice that beginning or ending a decoration may well be output operations,
   subject to failure. */
