   This assumes that p is a power of two and may evaluate both arguments
   multiple times.  However, if both arguments are constant expression, the
   expansion is also a constant expression.

   I learned this technique from from Hacker's Delight, ยง3-1.
   Let y be the smallest multiple of p greater than or equal to x, where p
   is a power of two.  Then:
     y = (x + p - 1) & - p     [1]
   and also

   I am currently using [1].  [2] can be useful in other contexts, because
   the second addend expresses a displacement from x to y. */

   There are basically two separate implementations of this, one relying on >>
   sign-extending on signed operands, like GCC does, and another generic but
   slow solution.  Which implementation is used depends on a constant expression
   checking how >> behaves at compile time.  I cannot think of any way of moving
   this logic to configure, as the check would depend on run-time behavior and
   would break under cross-compilation.

   Notice that the seemingly obvious alternative of doing a signed division by
   a power of two does not always compute the correct result with a negative
   operand in two's complement: the rounding direction for signed division is
   not what we need here. */

/* Expand to an expression which evalues the given word, which must have the given

   - the unsigned conversion of -1 (all bits set to 1), meaning true, when
     _jitter_word is positive;
   - the value 0, meaning false, when _jitter_word is negative.

   Rationale: this is conceived to materialize a Boolean result, usually to be
   further normalized with bitwise operations like in the macros below.
   Of course using this macro as the conditional or guard in a test or loop in C
   is not useful, as its entire point is to avoid branches. */

   be constant expressions for good performance.
   An important case use for this macro is a VM primitive returning a tagged
   Boolean result, which needs to be materialized.
   Define JITTER_CONDITIONAL_IF_NEGATIVE to use one of the two implementations
   below.  The API is identical and either implementation will work on every
   platform, but performance may differ.  On some machines (for example,
   PowerPC) straight-line code is often a huge win; on others it is just a
   modest improvement, and in a few cases (SH, and possibly x86_64) is

/* One of the two implementations of JITTER_CONDITIONAL_IF_NEGATIVE, in this

   Implementation note:
   The idea is rewriting
     (discriminand < 0) ? then : else
   to an expression of the following shape
     (discriminand < 0) & X ^ Y
   Now, (discriminand < 0) is either -1 or 0, as per
   JITTER_IS_NEGATIVE_ALL_ONES; it follows that (discriminand < 0) & X will be 0
   when discriminand >= 0.  Since the result must be else when discriminand >= 0
   we have that Y can only be else in order to have (0 ^ Y) = else.  At this
   point we can determine the right value for X: the xor operation with Y is
   applied unconditionally, and has the effect of flipping every 1 bit from
   else; but the only place where we can make the result be then is in X.  X
   must be such that xor-ing -1 & X with else gives then .  So, X must set the 1
   bits from then to the *opposite* configuration compared to what we aim for in
   the result, except for the ones which will are 1 in else; the bits from then
   will be flipped once, the ones from else will be flipped twice.
   It is not difficult to see that the solution is:
   * X = ~ (then ^ ~ else)
   * Y = else . */
