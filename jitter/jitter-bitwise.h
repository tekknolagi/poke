   to be nonzero, does *not* evaluate to a power of two.

#define JITTER_ISNT_A_POWER_OF_TWO(x)  \
  (((x) == 0) || JITTER_ISNT_NONZERO_A_POWER_OF_TWO(x))

/* Given a possibly integer x and a power of two p, expand to an expression
   evaluating to the maximum integer less than or equal to x which is a multiple
   of p.
   The signed version relies on two's complement representation.
   This assumes that p is a power of two and may evaluate both arguments
   multiple times.  However, if both arguments are constant expression, the
   expansion is also a constant expression. */
#define JITTER_PREVIOUS_MULTIPLE_OF_POWER_OF_TWO(x, p)  \
  ((x) & ~ ((p) - 1))

/* Given a possibly signed integer x and a power of two p, expand to an
   expression evaluating to the minimum integer greater than or equal to x which
   is a multiple of p.

   This assumes that p is a power of two and may evaluate both arguments
   multiple times.  However, if both arguments are constant expression, the
   expansion is also a constant expression.

   I learned this technique from from Hacker's Delight, ยง3-1.
   Let y be the smallest multiple of p greater than or equal to x, where p
   is a power of two.  Then:
     y = (x + p - 1) & - p     [1]
   and also
     y = x + (- x & (p - 1))   [2]
   I am currently using [1].  [2] can be useful in other contexts, because
   the second addend expresses a displacement from x to y. */

/* Given a positive integer a and a positive integer b, expand to a constant
   expression evaluating to the smallest integer greater than or equal to a
   which is a multiple of b.
   This may evaluate both arguments multiple times.  However, if both arguments
   are constant expression, the expansion is also a constant expression. */

   bits.  This is useful for playing with bit masks. */

/* Arithmetic right shifts.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* Expand to an r-value evaluating to the given word arithmetically
   right-shifted by _jitter_bit_nom , using the given types which must be
   unsigned and signed integer types of the same width.

   There are basically two separate implementations of this, one relying on >>
   sign-extending on signed operands, like GCC does, and another generic but
   slow solution.  Which implementation is used depends on a constant expression
   checking how >> behaves at compile time.  I cannot think of any way of moving
   this logic to configure, as the check would depend on run-time behavior and
   would break under cross-compilation.

   Notice that the seemingly obvious alternative of doing a signed division by
   a power of two does not always compute the correct result with a negative
   operand in two's complement: the rounding direction for signed division is
   not what we need here. */
