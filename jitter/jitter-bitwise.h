/* Given a possibly integer x and a power of two p, expand to an expression
   evaluating to the maximum integer less than or equal to x which is a multiple
   of p.
   The signed version relies on two's complement representation.
   This assumes that p is a power of two and may evaluate both arguments
   multiple times.  However, if both arguments are constant expression, the
   expansion is also a constant expression. */
#define JITTER_PREVIOUS_MULTIPLE_OF_POWER_OF_TWO(x, p)  \
  ((x) & ~ ((p) - 1))

/* Given a possibly signed integer x and a power of two p, expand to an
   expression evaluating to the minimum integer greater than or equal to x which
   is a multiple of p.

   This assumes that p is a power of two and may evaluate both arguments
   multiple times.  However, if both arguments are constant expression, the
   expansion is also a constant expression.

   I learned this technique from from Hacker's Delight, ยง3-1.
   Let y be the smallest multiple of p greater than or equal to x, where p
   is a power of two.  Then:
     y = (x + p - 1) & - p     [1]
   and also
     y = x + (- x & (p - 1))   [2]
   I am currently using [1].  [2] can be useful in other contexts, because
   the second addend expresses a displacement from x to y. */
