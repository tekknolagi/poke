/* Low-level versus high-level fast-branches.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* The low-level machine-specific definition for conditional fast branches, when
   available, "assume the worst case" in terms of constantness.  This means that
   low-level macros expand to inline assembly code actually performing a
   conditional, even when there is no need to because the condition is actually
   a compile-time constant.

   Low-level macros can assume they receive trivial arguments with no side
   effects, always either constants or variables, even if not necessarily known
   at compile time.  Argument evaluation happens *out* of low-level macros.

   Low-level macros are conceived for easy portability and make machine-specific
   code more declarative than algorithmic, but are not intended for the user.
   The user should always use high-level fast branches, defined in a
   machine-generated header as explained below (using machine-specific low-level
   fast-branches when available), which evaluate every comparison argument
   exactly once, rely on statements containing conditionals based on complex
   constant expression in order to eventually generate optimized code containing
   only a translation of the appropriate expansion of low-level macros.

   It is not necessary to protect low-level fast-branch operators with do..while
   (false).  The high-level definitions already wrap their uses.  Like elsewhere
   in Jitter, a macro whose name ends with "_" is unsafe in this respect, but
   is only used internally. */

/* This one low-level fast branch has a machine-independent definition, only
   relying on JITTER_PATCH_IN_SIZE_FAST_BRANCH_UNCONDITIONAL and
   JITTER_PATCH_IN_SIZE_FAST_BRANCH_UNCONDITIONAL , which of course are to
   be supplied in the machine-specific header.

/* Middle-level operate-and-branch-on-overflow.

/* The following definitions rewrite low-level operate-and-branch-on-overflow
   branches into other low-level operate-and-branch-on-overflow which are
   cheaper to compute, where possible.  These constitute a thin abstraction over
   low-level operate-and-branch-on-overflow, and are used internally in the
   machine-generated header descrbied below in order to implement high-level
   branches, of both the operate-and-branch-on-overflow and branch-on-overflow
   kinds.  Middle-level primitives do not optimize away overflow checks: that is
   done by high-level primitives, which will not resort to middle-level
   primitives (as there is be no need to: GCC will be able to optimize the
   operations written in C, in those cases) when the overflow checks yield
   results known at compile time, either always or never branching.
   Middle-level primitives are used in the "worst" case by high-level
   primitives, where the overflow condition is not known, but the operation
   might still be optimizable; the overflow check will remain in the rewrite.
   Of course nothing of this is intended for the user, who should only ever see
   high-level operations. */

   These are CPP macros rather than enum cases because the case values are used
   in inline assembly code (actually data), where a known value is used.  An
   assembly "immediate" constraint is not usable, as in some platforms immediate
   literals are always prefixed by a character such as $ or #, which is not
   needed or correct in data definitions.

   This complication is a pity: GCC documents the "x86 Operand Modifiers" as
   non-portable; having the equivalent of the 'c' modifier on every platform
   would allow for cleaner code.

   It is not necessary to use every case on any given machine, or to use only
   these.  Still it is convenient to have a centralized definition to reuse. */
