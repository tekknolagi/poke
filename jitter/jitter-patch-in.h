/* Introduction.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* The generated code in .text , to be expanded from VM instructions, will
   either skip enough bytes for an instruction to be patched-in later, or will
   generate temporary instructions with some argument to be replaced later; at
   the same time, the code generates a patch-in descriptor in a separate
   subsection, referring the preliminary code to patch with enough information
   to fill-in the missing data after replication.

   GCC may optimize away an entire patch-in, when the code is unreachable or, at
   least in theory, duplicate it.  This is not a problem: if there is no code to
   patch, no descriptor will refer it; in other words the code in .text 0 and in
   the subsections are treated as a unit, either both present or both optimized
   away.  For each code sequence to patch there will be one descriptor.

   This relies on the functionality in jitter-sections.h . */

   The "l" in the assembly template does *not* indicate a "gotolabel" argument
   for asm goto: jitter_vm_instruction_beginning is not passed as a gotolabel,
   but as an ordinary input argument.
   I used to pass the argument as a gotolabel, but the label was sometimes
   resolved to a slightly different address compared to what is computed by the
   prefix && operator under GCC 6 -- which broke patch-ins.  Elsewhere in Jitter
   I use prefix && to delimit the beginning and end of VM instruction code, so
   it is sensible to always compute these address the same way.

   The "l" modifier serves to omit the immediate-argument prefix "$" on i386 and
   x86_64, which would be syntactically incorrect in this context, out of an
   instruction.
   This "l" is documented in the GCC manual as one of the "x86 Operand
   Modifiers", but I see it working on any architecture -- doing nothing on
   architectures different from i386 and x86_64.  Should GCC's behavior change
   in the future it will be trivial to replace "l" with an architecture-specific
   macro expanding to "l" on i386 and x86_64 and nothing on every other. */
