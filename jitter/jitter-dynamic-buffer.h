/* A dynamic buffer is a structure holding a dynamically-allocated contiguous
   region of memory, resized and moved as needed.  The memory region can grow to
   contain user data added and removed in a LIFO fashion.  Any operation
   reserving space (but not operations just releasing space) may move the memory
   area, which would invalidate pointers to addresses within the dynamic memory
   region, but it is safe to point within the dynamic memory region after no
   reservation occurs.  At that point a pointer to the beginning of the dynamic
   memory region can be obtained.

   The buffer can hold homogenous data, working in practice as an array, or it
   can hold elements of varying size, under the control of the user.  The size
   of each element is *not* stored within the data structure, and the user has
   to keep track of such information if needed.

   The dynamically memory region is allocated with malloc , which entails some
   alignment restrictions.  No such constraint applies to individual elements,
   which are allocated as demanded by the user without any added padding. */
