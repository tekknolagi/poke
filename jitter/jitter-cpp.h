/* Local identifier poisoning.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* This feature serves to provide helpful error messages in case a code block
   contains a use of a locally forbidden identifier.  The identifier is poisoned
   at the beginning of the block and unpoisoned at the end.
   It is possible to poison functions, non-function globals, macros, and even C
   keywords.

   The implementation relies on non-standard GNU C features.  It is used
   conditionally in generated code.  Where the feature is not supported the
   system will fail in a less friendly way in case of incorrect code, but
   correctness will not be compromised. */

/* This is how to poison an indentifier foo, for example with the error message
   about relocatable VM instructions::
#    pragma push_macro ("foo")
#    undef foo
#    define foo JITTER_FORBIDDEN_EXPRESSION_IN_RELOCATABLE (foo)

   And this is how to unpoison it:
#    pragma pop_macro ("foo")

   In order to avoid spurious warning messages at the beginning of a sequence
   of poisonings, this should be generated (once):
#    pragma GCC diagnostic push
#    pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wpragmas"
#    pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunknown-warning-option"
#    pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wbuiltin-macro-redefined"
#    pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch"
   At the end, after unpoisoning, this restores the previous diagnostics state:
#    pragma GCC diagnostic pop  */
