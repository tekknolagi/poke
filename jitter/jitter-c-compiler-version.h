/* Jitter's advanced dispatches rely critically on compiler features, and in
   particular on using GCC rather than some other compiler.  If advanced
   dispatches are enabled at all then we want to verify that the compiler being
   used for compiling generated code in the same Jitter was configured for.

   We can be afford to be more lax with simple dispatches. */

   In the case of direct-threading, which still requires GNU C features, there
   will be some compiler error if the compiler being used is different from the
   one Jitter was configured for and the one being used does not support GNU C.
   This situation is tolerable, since the user will see the problem anyhow.  It
   is not feasible to recognise that the (unknown) compiler is the same, in
