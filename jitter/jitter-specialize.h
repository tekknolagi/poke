/* Executable routines.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* An executable routine is a data structure obtained from a routine, with a
   different internal representation meant for direct execution rather than
   modificaion -- the internal representation is in fact *very* different,
   particularly in sophisticated dispatching modes involving native code.

   Only an executable routine can be run on a VM, and only a non-executable
   routine can be modified by adding instructions and labels.

   Each non-executable routine can generate at most one executable routine.

   Once the executable routine has been generated (thru
   jitter_make_executable_routine ) the user is free to destroy the original
   non-executable routine in ordre to free resources, while the executable
   routine can be safely executed.  Destroying a non-executable routine is
   always allowed but may make disassembly and debugging information less
   precise. */

   as an abstract data type. */

     dispatching mode, have the same meaning as the fields with the same name
     from struct jitter_routine, and are copied from there.  See the comments in
     jitter-routine.h .
     The fields represented as struct jitter_dynamic_buffer in struct
     jitter_routine, for ease of incremental construction, here are simply
     heap-allocated buffers, whose size will no longer change.  In fact their
     heap storage is the same allocated within struct jitter_routine, obtained
     by extraction.  The finalization API for struct jitter_routine keeps this
     into account, and of course avoids freeing heap memory twice. */
