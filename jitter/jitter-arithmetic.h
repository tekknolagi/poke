/* Integer overflow checking and constant expressions.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* The code for checking overflow and for overflow-checking operations often
   benefits from optimizations, consisting in not generating conditionals in
   inline asm when the condition of overflow or non-overflow is known at
   compile time.  The logic for this optimization is in
      jitter/jitter-fast-branch-machine-generated.h
   , which is machine-generated by the script obtained from preprocessing
      scripts/generate-fast-branches.in.m4sh
   .

   The GCC builtin __builtin_constant_p fails to return true in several common
   cases which could be resolved at compile time, particularly with arguments
   including GCC's own overflow-checking builtins.  Instead of just using
   __builtin_constant_p on a Boolean expression involving overflow-checking
   builtins to check if a C condition can be resolved at compile time we
   can use the macros here, which are designed to evaluate to constants more
   easily.

   The expressions given as arguments must have no side effects.  The expansion
   (of non-side-effecting arguments) will always be a constant expression, even
   if the arguments are non-constant expressions.

   This will not of course catch every possible case where the property is
   known, as that would not even be computable, but should be both a correct
   conservative approximation, and good enough to optimize away many redundant
   overflow checks.  I have never seen a case where GCC is not able to generate
   straight-line code after one of these macros determined that the condition
   was constant.  Still, even if that happened, it would be just a matter of
   suboptimal performance, and not of correctness.

   The macros in this section are only used for advanced dispatches, which rely
   on GCC anyway.  No other compiler is supported. */

/* The following helper macros are all used internally in the rest of this
   section.

   expression evaluating to a Boolean telling, respectively, whether the
   expression is known to evaluate to the given value or known not to, whether
   an expression is known to evaluate to the same result as another, known to
   evaluate to a different result, known to evaluate to a positive or to a
   non-negative result. */
