/* This facility is meant to be used along with the pending_notifications field
   in struct jitter_special_purpose_state_data, accessible in The Array: see
   templates/vm.h .

   The data structures here allow notifying threads, or signal handlers, to
   express information about the specific signal to be handled. */

/* Information about one specific signal.  The Array in every VM state points
   to an array of structs, indexed by a signal number.
   Notice that even the superior sigaction API does not guarantee that multiple
   signals of the same type can reliably be distinguished by the receiver: see
   see The GNU libc manual, ยง"Advanced Signal Handling". */

  /* A Boolean value, meant to be as large as a pointer for reasons of
     atomicity.

     * must be reset to false again after handling a signal. */

   file including signal.h and use NSIG, but this paper-thin abstraction may be
   considered more elegant. */
