/* Tag checking, tagging and untagging.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* An C object of the appropriate type can be "encoded" into a Jitter object by
   representing it, or some pointer to it or to equivalent information in
   memory, combined with a "tag".  "Decoding" is the opposite process converting
   a Jitter object to a C object, or a pointer to it.

   A tag in this system is in the least significant bits of an object (be it a
   pointer in the case of a boxed object, or the object itself in case of an
   unboxed object); tags may be variable-length as long as it is possible to
   distinguish each different case by looking at a word.  Each case will have
   both a tag configuration and a tag length (in bits).

   Example:
     In a hypothetical system with just three types, integers cons and symbols,
     integers might have the 1-bit tag 0b0, conses the 2-bit tag 0b01 and
     symbols the 2-bit tag 0b11: the integer tag being shorter introduces no
     ambiguity, and makes one more bit available to the object payload.  By
     checking the last three bits on a word we can find its type, with
     conditionals or a table lookup.

   Encoding and decoding are non-destructive operations: they expand to
   expressions evaluating to values, and do not modify the result of their
   operand evaluation.  Memory allocation is a separate operation from encoding
   and decoding; memory operations are defined in jitter-allocator.h , not
   here. */

/* Style/mnemonic convention: these macros have arguments always following
   this order:
   - object;
   - tag;
   - tag-bit-no.
   The general-purpose macros for tagging and untagging objects, meant to be
   used for defining type-specific tagging and untagging, take all of the
   arguments above, in the order above, even if some unneeded arguments may
   never be evaluated.  This makes the code easier to modify. */

/* The stage tag and header tags.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* An object tag contains some type information about the object, but not
   necessarily all of it.  If the number of types in the system is too high to
   be encoded using just tag then one tag configuration and length is reserved
   as the "stage tag".  An object whose tag is the stage tag is always boxed,
   and encodes a pointer to a struct whose first field is a word-sized "header
   tag", followed by type-dependent data.  Not all unboxed objects are
   header-tagged: for efficiency reasons some boxed types which are very
   frequently used, such as conses in Lisp, may have a tag which is sufficient
   to identify the object type alone, and in that case the memory representation
   of the object will have no header tag.

   Example:
     A hypothetical system might have fixnums, symbols, the empty list, conses,
     vectors and strings.  Lists are commonly used and their efficiency is
     paramount, so we don't want conses to have a header tag and we want the
     empty list to be unique and unboxed.
     A reasonable tag assignment for this system would be:
     - 2-bit: 0b00 for fixnums, unboxed;
     - 2-bit: 0b01 for the empty list, unboxed;
     - 2-bit: 0b10 for conses, boxed, no header tag;
     - 2-bit: 0b11 as the stage tag.
     Symbols, vectors and strings will be stage-tagged, and their header tag
     will contain three different values in order to distinguish each type from
     the other two.  Notice that symbols can still be compared by identity
     without touching memory: the tagged object points to a struct containing
     the symbol attributes, not to another pointer; if symbols are interned then
     tagged objects for equal symbols will be equal.

   Any object of a header-tagged type is heap-allocated as a struct, of which
   the first field is a header tag named jitter_header_tag , and the second is
   named jitter_payload.  The actual external struct type depends on the
   internal payload type, also a struct, and there may be padding space between
   the header tag and the payload; however we assume that there is no padding
   before the header tag, so that the same header-tag extraction code works for
   any header-tagged type. */
