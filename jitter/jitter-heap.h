   memory allocation and freeing of buffers from larger blocks.  A heap in
   this sense is sometimes called a "memory pool".

   This has nothing to do with the tree data structure imposing ordering
   constraints, also called "heap". */

// FIXME: a few words about policies (first-fit in a LIFO-ordered non-segregated
// free list [hole list here], immediate coalescing), single blocks and heaps.
// Wilson's survey citing his own work [p. 68, left column seems to strongly
// favor FIFO over LIFO.  Wilson's arguments seem very reasonable; I am only
// worried about stronger cache effects on current machines, 25 years after
// his publication.
// I can experiment quite easily with FIFO, or conditionalize.]

/* A "block" is a memory interval containing a header, plus space for the

   space, without relying on external memory allocation facilities.  The same

   relying on external memory. */

   memory.
   Each thing can be:
   - a terminator (a special marker at the beginning and end of each block);
   - a hole (currently unused memory);
   - an object (currently used memory).
   Holes within a single block are linked together in a doubly-linked list,
   always preceded by the left terminator and followed by the right
   terminator.
   Currently, the last freed block is the first in the list (after the
   left terminator).
