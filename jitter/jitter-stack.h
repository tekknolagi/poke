   or (SH -- here one of the four instructions is justified by SH's two-operand
       arithmetic, but the problem of keeping two different pointers is still
       the same):
      # 0x423a30: stackdrop (8 bytes):
      f664e02e b3 63    mov r11,r3
      f664e030 b2 6e    mov.l @r11,r14

      f664e034 33 6b    mov r3,r11
  The uncommented version above does the right thing, yielding two
  instructions (or just one on Aarch64 and ARM, using a post-decrementing load).
  The under-top pointer is declared restrict , so GCC cannot assume
  that the under-top pointer may alias the top; and in fact the top is
  correctly held in a register, even with this three-instruction version.
  Tested on GCC 8.0.0 20170430 , the same on every architecture. */

/* Potentially inefficient stack operations.

/* The stack operations defined in this section may expand to inefficient code

   small constants.  Anyway they are convenient for testing. */


/* Expand to a statement rearranging the topmost roll_depth + 1 elements of
   the given stack so that the element originally at depth roll_depth goes to
   top, and every element originally above it is moved down one position to
   make place.
   For example, passing roll_depth with a value of 3 turns
     a b c d e f
   into
     a b d e f c
   .  In Forth the depth argument is taken from the stack.  Here
     JITTER_STACK_TOS_ROLL(type, stack_container, name, N)
   behaves like
     N roll
   in Forth. 
   Just like in Forth, roll is a potentially inefficient operation, as it
   requires O(roll_depth) memory accesses.  In production it should only be
   used with small and constant values of roll_depth . */

/* Expand to a statement performing a stack change to delete a given number of
   non-top elements at the given depth.
   * The element_no argument is the number of elements to delete.  It must be
     non-negative;
   * the depth argument is the depth of the deepest element to delete.  It must
     be strictly positive.
   For good performance both arguments should be known at compile time.
   It is forbidden for this operation to change the top element: the metaphor of
   "sliding" is a landslide where some below-ground strata collapse, which cause
   a displacement of the surface layer down (potentially along with other layers)
   without changing the surface.
   After the operation is executed the stack will be element_no elements shorter.
   Undefined behavior on:
   * underflow;
   * top element write;
   * any over-the-top element access.
   For example
     slide 1 1
   is equivalent to nip, and has the stack effect
     ( a b -- b )
   .  Then
     slide 2 2
   is equivalent to nip nip, and has the stack effect
     ( a b c -- c )
   and
     slide 1 2
   has the stack effect
     ( b c d -- c d )
   This is a generalization of nip, fast when the arguments are known at compile
   time but potentially dangerous to use because of the possibility of accessing
   the top element or even elements above the top by mistake, which may lead to
   subtly incorrect results. */

/* Compute the given "setter" on the under-top and top elements of the stack, in

   This expands to a statement, and there is no result.  Undefined behavior
   on an empty or one-element stack.
   The "setter" is supposed to be the name of a three-argument macro expanding
   to a statement which modifies its first argument (an l-value expression)
   using the other two (r-value expressions), in order.  The setter body may be
   protected with the usual do .. while (false) idiom, but does not need to be.

   Example:
#define SETPLUS(res, a, b)      do { res.field = a.field + b.field; } while (0)
   JITTER_STACK_TOS_BINARY(union my_union, stack, , SETPLUS);
#undef  SETPLUS */
