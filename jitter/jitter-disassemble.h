/* Disassemble the given routine to the given print context using a pipe to
   objdump, or falling back to a binary dump if such functionality is not
   available or fails at run time.  The internal implementation is quite
   inefficient, as it relies on one objdump invocation per specialised
   instruction.
   
   The output uses the following class names (see jitter/jitter-print.h), with
   "vmprefix" replaced by the lower-case name of the VM for the mutable routine:
   - vmprefix_comment;
   - vmprefix_memory_address;
   - vmprefix_native_instruction_hex;
   - vmprefix_disassembly. */
