/* Introduction.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* This is an efficient implementation of a set data structure using pointers as
   keys, based on open-address hashing and mostly designed for one specialised
   purpose: holding the remembered set in a generational garbage collector.
   In that application the critical operation is add-unique.
   (For a more generic but heavyweight alternative please see
   jitter/jitter-hash.h ; that implementation, differently from this one,
   includes sophisticated hash functions achieving a good "randomness".)

   The keys are non-NULL non-1 pointers (those two values are reserved), aligned
   as required by the machine ABI.

   Keys have no associated data: this data structure implements a set or a
   multiset, not a map.

   It features very efficient access, with an intentionally simple and "bad"
   first hash function.
   The table is automatically resized, always to a power of two, when the fill
   factor reaches a fixed threshold.  Collisions are handled by double hashing.
   Key removal is supported by marking removed elements as deleted, without
   reusing space.  The table access routines have been designed never to
   require multiplication, division, remainder.

   Both hash functions return an *offset* in bytes instead of an index, which
   saves one instruction on RISCs and makes the memory operand simpler on CISCs.

   If pointers are aligned in this configuration, then the first has function
   directly uses the key as the result offset: the address of every key is also
   word aligned and has the same low bits at zero: in this case the first hash
   function can be the identity function, which costs zero instructions to
   compute.  On hypothetical bizarre ABIs not requiring pointer alignment (I am
   speaking of the pointers themselves not beginning at a machine-word boundary,
   not about pointers pointing to unaligned data) the hash function masks off
   the low bits, using a compile-time-constant mask.

   The offset which is the result of either hash function needs to be masked to
   make it wrap around; the mask is stored in the data structure, updated when
   the structure is resized.


   Thanks to Bruno Haible for suggesting the use of double hashing in the first
   place, after hearing of my initial more naïve version relying on linear
   probing.  Bruno also cited Knuth's analysis and suggested the idea of h2 as
   defined below.  About h2 I do not claim to have followed his suggestions
   exactly, and any remaining oversights are mine. */

/* The initial allocated size of an empty table, in elements.
   This must be an even power of two. */
#define JITTER_POINTER_SET_INITIAL_ELEMENT_NO  8//(1 << 10)//2//(1 << 16)//64 // 64

/* This is the reciprocal of the maximum table fill ratio a. Assuming uniformity
   an upper bound on the expected number of probes in a successful search is
     1 / a * ln (1 / (1 - a))
   .  The analysis can be found in Knuth and in Cormen-Leiserson-Rivest-Stein.
   Apart from the question of the optimal choice of a value this is allowed
   to be any number greater than one, even floating-point.  This value is only
   used for computing the used-element limit (an integer) when initialising and
   resizing a table, so the efficiency of computations using it is not really
   critical.
   Since the table is built associatively but also scanned linearly it is
   important to strike a balance between the optimisation of the number of
   probes and the density of valid elements.
   This is a convenient way to sample possible values from Emacs:
     (dolist (a (sort (list (/ 16.0) (/ 8.0) (/ 4.0) (/ 2.0)
                            (/ 10.0) (/ 5.0) (/ 3.0)
                            .4 .6 (/ 2 3.0) (/ 3 4.0) (/ 4 5.0))
                      '<=))
       (let* ((a (float a))
              (reciprocal-a (/ a))
              (probe-no (* (/ a) (log (/ (- 1 a))))))
         (insert (format "     a:%7.3f   reciprocal-a:%7.3f   probe-no:%7.3f\n"
                  a reciprocal-a probe-no))))

   performance, return an *offset* in bytes, not an index.

   The pointer set uses double hashing: the first hash h1, given a key k,
   returns an offset into the buffer; in case of collision the probe distance
   (again as an offset) from the first offset is the result of the second hash
   h2 on the key.  Each probe after the first is at distance h2 (k) modulo the
   table size M from the previous one.
   The i-th probe will be therefore at offset
     (h1 (k) + i h2 (k)) mod M
   .  Only if the first probe fails there is need to compute h2 (k), and in
   that case it can be computed just once, even if more probes are needed after
   the second.  The modulo needs to be computed at each probe, but it should be
   efficient requring as it does only one bitwise and operation.  In critical
   code, where multiple accesses occur in a loop, the mask will be loaded once
   from memory and then kept in a register. */

   of the (always even) word size.
