# Test a simple program decrementing a register up to zero; the first version
# uses only the %r0 register, which should be fast; the second uses %r100,
# which should be slow.  These contain no unconditional jumps, and always
# execute at least one iteration.

# Similar to the previous cases, but using two registers.  This tests a simple
# program decrementing a register up to zero while incrementing another from
# zero; the first version uses registers %r0 and %r1, which should be fast; the
# second uses %r100 and %r101, which should be slow.
# These check for the termination condition at the end of each iteration, and
# contain one conditional and one unconditional jump.
