/* Rationale.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* The problem is filtering a test case output into a one-line normalized form,
   easy to compare for equality with a hand-written expected output, in Jitter's
   test suite.

   After becoming very annoyed by the lack of portability of sed scipts and tr
   command lines I decided to write this stupid program myself.  I have been
   surprised twice in a few days by the counter-intuitive behavior of two
   different, and quite widely used, sed implementations; with tr I have not had
   negative experiences yet, but the Autoconf manual warnings have alerted me.

   Just relying on GNU semantics is unfortunately not feasible here if I want
   portability.  My strive for portability has already improved the quality of
   the code, and within reasonable limits is a good thing. */




/* Specification.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* This program performs the following transformation:

   - '\r' characters are completely ignored in the input, and never produced in
     the output: an input consisting of only '\r' characters is considered
     empty;
   - empty input becomes empty output;
   - in non-empty input every '\n' character except one at the very end of
     the input (possibly followed by '\r' characters only) becomes a '/'
     character;
   - the last character in the input, if '\n', remains '\n' in the output;
   - if the last character in the input is not '\n' then an '\n' is appended to
   the output.

   The input cannot contain '\0' or '/' characters.  (Rationale: '/' characters
   could be supported as ordinary characters, but I expect they will almost
   always be used by mistake: the fact that they become undistinghishable from
   '\n' in most circumstances makes them unsuitable to used in test cases).

   This syntax makes it very convenient to express the expected output, even
   consisting of mulitple lines, within one line, as encoded by this program.
   Each test case output will be filtered through this program and compared.

   Examples:
     ""             -->  ""
     "\r"           -->  ""
     "\n"           -->  "\n"
     "\n\n"         -->  "/\n"
     "a"            -->  "a\n"
     "a\nb"         -->  "a/b\n"
     "a\nb\n"       -->  "a/b\n"
     "a\nb\nc"      -->  "a/b/c\n"
     "a\nb\nc\n"    -->  "a/b/c\n"
     "a\nb\nc\n\n"  -->  "a/b/c/\n"  */
