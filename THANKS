I wish to thank the people who showed an interest in this project and
contributed with feedback or encouragement.  Some are personal friends, others I
have only met online; even those whom I only know by an IRC nickname have been
important.

* José Marchesi, the first serious user of Jitter in an external software, has
  always provided suggestions and useful, constructive feedback.
  José also helped me to begin the SPARC port, teaching me about the
  architecture as I was writing the first code in machine/sparc with him at my
  side.

* Bruno Haible intervened in an IRC conversation and discussed with me for a
  long time about hashing and garbage collection.  I appreciate how he made a
  strong effort to prevent me from making a wrong choice and proactively
  criticised my design to warn me of possible problems, adopting my own
  obsession with optimisation as a point of view for the scope of the exchange.
  Bruno also sent fixes and patches, in his usual precise and helpful style.

* Mohammad-Reza Nabipoor reported bugs, asked many questions about Jitter and
  appreciated its complexity.  Interacting with him was particularly pleasant
  and motivating.

* Darshit Shah reported several bugs in a very precise way, more than once
  providing fixes.

* Alfred M. Szmidt made me notice a few bugs preventing portability to BSD
  systems, and contributed to my porting effort with long friendly discussions.

* Niobos helped by testing changes on her configuration.

* xelxebar helped me to debug a problem with the shebang lines in scripts, testing
  in unusual configurations.

* Dan Čermák sent a useful bug report and automatic analysis results.

* Galex reported some typos.

I wish to thank the people who maintained a package for Jitter; I know of
Darshit Shah, but there are others as well who would deserve a mention here.
