I wish to thank the people who showed an interest in this project and
contributed with feedback or encouragement.  Some are personal friends, others I
have only met online; even those whom I only know by an IRC nickname have been
important.

* José Marchesi, the first serious user of Jitter in an external software, has
  always provided suggestions and useful, constructive feedback.

* Bruno Haible intervened in an IRC conversation and discussed with me for a long
  time about hashing and garbage collection.  I appreciate how he made a strong
  effort to prevent me from making a wrong choice and proactively criticised my
  design to warn me of possible problems, adopting my own obsession with
  optimisation as a point of view for the scope of the exchange.

* Darshit Shah reported several bugs in a very precise way, more than once
  providing fixes.

* Alfred M. Szmidt made me notice a few bugs preventing portability to BSD
  systems, and contributed to my porting effort with long friendly discussions.

* Bruno Haible sent fixes and patches, in his usual precise and helpful style.

* Niobos helped by testing changes on her configuration.

* xelxebar helped me to debug a problem with the shebang lines in scripts, testing
  in unusual configurations.

* Dan Čermák sent useful bug report and automatic analysis results.

* Galex reported some typos.

I wish to thank the people who maintained a package for Jitter; I know of
Darshit Shah, but there are others as well who would deserve a mention here.
